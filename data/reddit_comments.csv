Problem with car drivers is that they drive their cars like f motorbikes. U-turns anywhere blocking whole traffic.
What things do people do during traffic that trigger you the most? Mine is pavement-driving.
"Typical experience in my neighbourhood

Me, turning left with my signal on and full safety riding gear

Nguyen, with his whole family on board whipping by at 80km/hr with no helmets passes me on the left while I'm mid turn with inches to spare while screaming ""YO YO YO YO"" 

Honestly I prefer the car drivers 90% of the time. They're incredibly aggressive, but mostly attentive and almost always signal so you actually know what the fuck they're about to do."
"2 hours? Ugh, that's hell in Vietnam on a motorbike. You need to move."
"I think with the drivers/driving here, either you learn to accept the chaos and laugh at the insanity of it all, or you just have to move away from the city. I went on a road trip with a friend today and on the way back into Saigon we were stuck in one of the biggest cluster fucks I've ever seen. Around 100+ bikes turning into this side road had stopped all four lanes of a QL, traffic lights be damned.  I was getting annoyed because I had been driving all day and my ass hurt and I just wanted to get home. But then I made eye contact with this random chú who was just looking around at the situation and smiling, enjoying the ridiculousness of it all. That snapped me out of it. I grinned back while shaking my head, and we both laughed. 

&#x200B;

On a completely different note... I would pay so much money to see one of these helmetless retards who likes to weave through traffic on his ~~Exciter~~ fucboi express turn his head into a pancake with the back of a bus."
Why have you arranged your life to include 2 hour drives? The city is way more walkable than people allow themselves to believe ....
"You've just got to understand that's the way of the city. When I would go to eat somewhere in a different district, I was going to meet my gf for lunch, go to teach English, etc., I just expected it would take an hour. It isn't convenient, but it's just the way it is.  
  
Also, be careful about your GoPro being easily grabbed by someone. I recorded about 20 mins of 4K footage with my Lumix camera... but I had it firmly in hand and with a wrist strap on."
">be me
>in Saigon
>take the bus
>thinking: ""sure it takes a bit more time but it's safe and air conditioned""
>couple week ago, the bus driver suddenly had a heated arguement over the phone with another bus driver.

There is no escape, even on public transport. Feelbadman."
"I mean, the traffic in Vietnam is unlikely to improve drastically over night to give you peace of mind when commuting. However, I’d suggest you choose a different route to travel, a different time to leave, or move closer to to work.

Bad drivers and motorcycles and random u-turn or illegal crossing will happen, best to change how you deal with it (or not to deal with it at all) to give yourself less stress and frustration."

🤣🤣🤣 traffic and Vietnam are synonymous
Where do you live and are commuting to/from that takes that long?
"Head on a swivel, and drive defensively as if everyone is trying to kill you. I’ve since moved but the years of Saigon riding has given me ptsd and forever changed my driving habits to that of a grandma."
Juicy orange arrows
"Gotta be at least 5 times a day where I’m tempted to smash the mirror of an asshole car driver and zoom off into the sunset (only to get caught 50 meters down the road when I inevitably run into a traffic jam caused by cars parked in the bike lane and buses trying to merge into bumper-to-bumper traffic to save themselves 30 seconds of travel time).  

It’s a shame cause I love riding motorbikes but half the time I’m riding I just feel frustrated/nervous."
It’s definitely a culture shock for me moving from Nha Trang to Saigon. The traffic was the main thing that kept me from liking to live in Saigon.
"During tourist season where I live the traffic goes mental because the bus and car drivers all come out and think they’re rally drivers.  I’ll come around a blind turn with a steep rising cliff to one side and short drop into dense trees on the other, only to find two busses trying to overtake each other heading straight at me on what’s effectively a 1.5 lane road."
"Motorbike is the only ideal solution for this city since all roads are too small and they dont seem to have a plan to widen these anyway. 

&#x200B;

Or maybe until... better public transportation is available (tram, public buses etc) like any big cities would have."
Welcome to this world
":D, that's why I decided not to stay in HCMC and HN. The longer you stay, the more stress you get."
"VN traffic is basically “law of the jungle” meaning; the larger the vehicle the more it gets to own the road. Motos will go around pedestrians cars might not, busses and trucks will plow you down where you stand

It’s a jungle out there"
"Or when you have a small road just big enough for one lane of car and one small lane of motorbike, and you have these assholes who put on the turn signal and go over to the motorbike lane just so he can cut the line. Or you have the assholes who honk 5 times when the light is about to turn green or when he's pushing you over on a small 2-way road. Or when the assholes back up after missing a turn. Or when the assholes make a sharp turn without signal because them motorcyclists can just stop for me. I can go on forever. 

Vietnamese 4-wheel-and-up drivers are assholes. Period."
"6'2"" me on the back of my gf's moto nearly got killed by an asshole in an SUV my 3rd day in Sai Gon because he didn't look before he turned right into us. It's not like he couldnt' see a giant white man right next to him if he really looked."
The horn is not part of the ignition... blasting it non stop the whole time you drive just makes the sound meaningless. It also drives me mental
"Cars taking up motorbike lanes' space. I personally don't do pavement-driving but there are times during rush hours the motorbike's lanes would be occupied by cars. In such situation, if I don't get on the pavements, I'm basically risking losing my balance due to the little space I have between myself and the cars."
"They divide lanes for 4+ wheels vehicles and motorbikes separately, cars proceed to takeover the motorbikes lane, creating one more ""ghost"" lane, forcing motorbikes to drive on pavements... that, that pisses me off the most..."
"When cars straddle 2 lanes waiting to see which one is moving faster, leaving a tiny space for bikes to pass which slows down both lanes."
"Not using their signal. 

Some keep flashing their fucking signal for a whole 1km, are u fucking gonna turn?

Some just turn without any signal."
"Hah guilty... Just bought a dirt bike which means I can bounce over the kerbs as smooth as silk, literally overtaking local Airbladers on the pavement.

If you can't beat em, join em..."
Unless you're behind them and they just decide to throw it in reverse
"Seriously. I moved to my job. 5 minute commute. More free time, less time breathing pollution. It has improved my live quality a lot."
I saw a dead guy on the way back to saigon from Vung Tau. His head was flattened...didn’t look like he was wearing a helmet. Blood was just in streams across the road. Pretty gruesome sight.
Lolol not with the burning sun and people parking on the pavements tho.
"> Why have you arranged your life to include 2 hour drives? 

Agree 100%, that's insane. 

> The city is way more walkable than people allow themselves to believe .... 

You are a little crazy too though haha :p between the piles of trash, the motorbikes, and crossing alleys, walking on the sidewalk blows. It's also hot AF out there"
This only happens in asian large cities. Never seen it anywhere else.

"That's why I didn't ask my parent for a bike the first year in uni. Bus commuter pass, least for student and my 10km distance, is way cheaper than monthly fuel price of a bike. You get over the attitude problem and then you can enjoy the most cost-effective, comfortable mode of transportation in Hanoi. Heard that in Saigon they got discount ticket books, quite a hassle compared to flashing the pass to the conductor here."
It blows my mind why anyone would choose to live in Hanoi. Going anywhere at any time involves risking your life and sanity.
Was recently on a sleeper bus and traffic in both lanes was completely brought to a hault. As we passed by we saw that a big tractor trailer had run over two motorbikes. The entire cabin was engulfed in flames. Hopefully the people on the motorbikes were still alive.
"Omg the assholes that drive their big ass cars to the motorbike's lanes take the cake for me, as if congestion on one lane is just not enough for them."
Just to let you know there is no motorbike lane. It’s entirely legal for car drivers to drive on both lane.
Also your shiny bald head
">he couldnt' see a giant white man right next to him if he really looked.

You make it sound he should've seen you because you're white. Take your white privilege to your own country and get the fuck out of Asia white boy."
True.... Repetitive sounds drive me nuts too
"Just one single car in the bike lane will hold up the entire flow of traffic, yet the very second a bike crosses over to the car territory, everybody loses their mind. 

Once during heavy traffic, some asshole car driver tried to jam himself in the motorbike lane just to skip the line. I didn't yield and ended up scratching his door. The fucker stepped out and tried to physically beat me and make me pay up. People called the police over, and the policeman gave him a fine for driving in the wrong lane. It was a no stopping no parking straight road so he had zero excuse to pull over.

It's been my favorite hobby since, to not yield to selfish pricks and scratching their sidedoor for fun, because legally they hit me and are not entitled to a compensation. Lately I've been driving a more expensive bike and can't do that anymore."
"Oh shit, I've never seen that happen!"
Ouch. Brutal. Sorry you had to see that unwillingly... here's to hoping that won't be either of us some day.
"Ah, ok. I was only in Sai Gon and Phan Thiet. I didn't get out to much else when I was there, I am hoping to explore the countryside on the way to Meekong next time I go for Tet."
[deleted]
"I'm not sure about the price because I think I put about $10-15 into my bike a month if commuting once a day, but generally it ended up being twice so it can add up; however the convenience of going out is invaluable instead of waiting for buses, especially so when the routes change without warning."
"I’m trying to walk across the street during rush hour, waiting for at least a little break to make my move. I’m standing there saying “come on, come on, come on!”

I realize I’m standing at the side of the road saying “thank you” to the traffic...

Yeah life in Hanoi eventually makes you insane"
hey i never said the roads were safe here. its fucking insane.
"There are roads where it’s only legal for cars to get over to motorbike-designated lane to make a right turn. That stretch of road on Long Thanh with 4 lanes of car and one lane of motorbike comes to mind. Of course, the car can just turn on the signal and go forever, so that doesn’t mean much."
"Yes there is
https://img.otofun.net/upload/v4/372269/984_vd.jpg?t=1470718913735"
Relearn the traffic laws dumbass. People like you are the reason why cars think it's okay to take up the motorbike lane.
"Actually, very accurate."
You just perceive it that way. Found the racist.
"Well it ceases to have any meaning. There’s always horns sounding so I just ignore it all together... if someone actually had to warn me of impending disaster with their horn it would be useless

And the guys (usually kids) on the totally silent electric bikes.. they’re the only ones who never actually blow their horns. Every time I’ve almost been smoked crossing the street it’s been a silent electric scooter... they sneak right up on you"
I’m trying to get over my road rage and be more safe after seeing that but it’s difficult. My biggest pet peeve is people on their phones. Grab bikes and go Viet are a menace too. They’re always in a rush or drying slow on their phone... I can’t even count how many times they’ve almost hit me while cutting me off.
Traffic in Vietnam + road rage and anger management issues. Perfect recipe for disasters.
"You go relearn it. There are motorbike lanes but in a normal two lanes configuration without any signs, cars can go in both lanes. Stupid."
"Yeah the phone use thing is insane. Fucking pull over!! One of these days I'm going to swat someone's phone out of their hand lol. And yes fuck Grab/GoViet drivers, they clearly prioritize getting the ride done over their/their passengers' safety quite often. That's what made me stop taking them and learn to drive after I moved here. This is some princess shit but I actually only take cars now if I need a grab. Some of them just can't chill and be patient for safety's sake and it's not cool... running lights, squeezing inbetween trucks, etc."
You almost never see VN people road raging... even in major accidents. Everyone involved just seems to look embarrassed... the whole “save face” attitude that makes throwing a fit a big taboo in Asia... North American drivers could take a HUGE page out of that book. In North America I’ve seen young healthy adult men chase down and assault senior citizens because they used their turn signal incorrectly. And it’s usually the same sort of racist dick who goes around saying asians are the worst drivers. I’d love to see one those fools try and drive in Hanoi... he wouldn’t make it ten feet
"Oh for real, that's why I left, but that driver got what he deserved for being a dangerous piece of shit, he could have killed me."
"Let me repeat that for you, since you can't fucking read:

""Mo-tor-bike lane"": a lane for motorcycle (motorized vehicles with two wheels)

Which indicates that the lane is dedicated to motorcycles. A car, which has 4 wheels, is not a motorcycle. Thank you for listening."
"I think about smacking phones constantly. Then I have to tell myself “relax, this isn’t your country you have to respect the locals” but some of them are little shits."
"I saw 4 guys pull a truck driver out of his truck and beat the shit out of him, stomping his head, and kicking him until he was able to roll under the truck and the guys' screaming wives pulled them back into their minivans at about 2 in the afternoon."
"Dude how long have you been in Vietnam? Road rage is practically the norm here. Everybody, young guys, young girls, middle aged women, middle aged men, will throw profanities and punches at you. In extreme cases you get stabbed or beaten to death. Mostly, people take off their helmets and smash you with it.

It's less common in the South for some reason, but in the North people can get violent so easily."
[deleted]
"Exactly. We are ambassadors here, and it'd be a shame for someone's opinion of foreigners to be ruined by a little road rage. Recently though after a shit day of work I did give someone (no helmet/speeding/no-look turn) the finger. He proceeded to speed past me, and decided he needed to turn his entire torso around to face backwards and flip me off too. That's when he bounced his scooter off of a car, nearly killing himself lmao..."
"i guess im just lucky. i never see shit get ugly. might help im big and scary looking (thats what everyone in the west always told me, even though im non violent... i just got one of those faces...)

but ive seen a bunch of accidents in town in hanoi and they were all really civil. i drink tons and go to all the dive bar bia hoi joints.. nobody seems to cause shit. i know theres an ""underground"" a ""mafia"" and tons of violence that most foriegners never see, but overall... its pretty chilled out here compared to the idiotic shit you see back home (just check r/fightporn or r/publicfreakout... and yes i realize about 10% of that shit is asian content.. but... TEN percent... of 70% of the planet's population... theres an imbalance there)"
"two years. never a problem

granted, that could change at any minute"
"Which law?? I fucking dare you to find me a law that says cars can drive on the motorcycle lane on roads without signs.

Do I need to take a picture of my driving license?
As a matter of fact, what's your plate? I'd love to report a lane-crossing fucktard to the cops.

If a one-way street has 2 lanes, motorized vehicles have to drive on the left, while non-motorized vehicles drive on the right:
https://luatminhkhue.vn/tu-van-luat-dan-su/quy-dinh-ve-lan-duong-khi-tham-gia-giao-thong.aspx?gclid=Cj0KCQjwrdjnBRDXARIsAEcE5YllPGUnl_gbs9jb3NYL2URkwgg4PXLaZ6kDb-kp-4vSyefF1E53krkaAqoVEALw_wcB

2 way streets with 2 lanes or more are required to have signage. If there are no signage, then there is no distinction between those drawn lines. In that case, there is NO motorcycle lane NOR car lane.

The only case where what you said is true is a 2 lane street with a sign reading: car lane + car and motorbike lane. It has to say so specifically, because legally both cars and motorbikes are motorized vehicles and can drive on the same lane EXCEPT WHERE THE SIGN FORBIDS SO.

So now let's re-read the bullshit you wrote:

""There's no motorbike lane""

""Car can drive on both lanes""

""Normal configuration without any sign""

Shut the fuck up and never drive ANY vehicle again."
RIP
"You do realize that the way you personally look has nothing to do with violence that breaks out between other people, right? 

Also, you do realize that things that are uploaded to whichever subreddit are in no way an actual representation of things that happen in reality, right?"
Triggered? Today’s dose of lead in your blood brain high again?
"no one ever fucks with me and im a total pussy cat. theres got to be a reason. and you arent the first person to insist i'm missing something either, i just have never seen it...yet?

you do realize these type of forums are about individual opinion based on personal experience and arent gospel ... do you?"
"You've lost the argument, can't find that imaginary law you're talking about, and can only downvote and insult like a coward. 

You drive in the wrong lane, think you're right, say that I'm an ""idiot"" that doesn't know the law. I provided links , facts and explanation.

Saying someone is ""triggered"" is not an escape out of a losing argument. Are you a 13yo tumblr kid? How did you get your car licence being underage????? 

Oh wait, you don't even know how to drive, my bad.

Again, where's that law you're referring to?"
The law that allows me to cut you over on your imaginary bike lane.
"How old are you? Are you sure you're old enough to drive? Your weak arguments sounds like a todler throwing a tantrum.

Big speak about laws, yet still uses law of the jungle lol"
"1. Chaos exists, but we dream of a better future for the next generation.

2. It will take time and education, but rules can be created and enforced. I would point to other rules and other countries as examples. Or even just to the general march of history.

3. No one likes the traffic. I drive along one of the worst stretches of HCMC every day. There are no other effective ways to get to my office (there are no taxis in my area during rush hour). I look forward to public transit in the form of elevated and light rail -- maybe I'll even move somewhere else just to use it instead of driving.

I agree that complaining isn't helpful, although just pretending the problem doesn't exist isn't super useful either. I think the best way to move forward is to remove this idea that 'nothing can be done therefore my bad behavior is justified' (I'm not accusing you of this, I just hear it a lot). Of course something can be done... I can choose to follow the rules and encourage others to do the same!"
"Foreigners aren't the only people who complain about the traffic, as you seem to imply. Also the government routinely highlights traffic congestion as a huge problem: it wastes people's time, causes economic losses, and generates pollution/emissions, plus it's deadly, as others have mentioned. And to echo other comments, not everyone can afford a taxi - some people can't even afford a Grab Bike. Asking 'why do you even drive' if you don't like the traffic is just ignorant. 

I don't think anyone expects there to be quick fixes given Vietnam's stage of development, but simply never discussing something which impacts almost everyone's life on a daily basis would be bizarre."
"Why can't people criticize aspects of Vietnams infrastructure without being told to 'stop complaining'? If you don't see that Vietnam clearly has an issue with traffic, crowded roads, poor enforcement of traffic laws, and the serious lack of public transport then I dunno what to say. That being said, after having been to Vietnam twice now, there are many aspects of it I enjoy and I try not to be a Viet Kieu who criticizes the current state of Vietnam without a historical and material understanding. 

When I went to Vietnam my first time, within the first week I witnessed three separate traffic accidents including an incident where a family of three (one of them was a todler) crashed into another biker in a crowded intersection. Personally, I don't see why that needs to be 'a way of life'. Perhaps I'm out of touch though, just my thoughts."
"If traffic rules aren’t meant to be obeyed, what are they for? Decorations? Admitting there’s a problem is the first step to solving it. Do you know how many accidents happened over Tet? Around 6,000 people are killed a year in traffic accidents, making Vietnam one of the highest-road-fatality countries. So we shouldn’t complain? Shouldn’t want to be safer on the road? Shouldn’t want our fellow citizens to observe road safety to be safe themselves???

Also you don’t even drive. Once you’re behind the wheel you see things differently. That’s such a classist statement “why the heck are you driving in the city?” Because people need to work, pick up their kids, go buy groceries, meet with clients, etc and can’t afford someone else driving them. 

I’m not delusional to think people change overnight. But I do believe change starts with each person, so I do my part of making sure I and drivers around me are safe. If everyone thinks like you, around 6,000 people will continue to die per year."
"so...you're assuming people have money to get a taxi everywhere? what if they don't live close to the centre? what if it costs them easily 100k each day just to go to the market 1 way? 

It's not just the traffic. it's also pollution. Very bad for everyone's health. Unless you've experienced driving yourself, you can't really complain. 

I used to be like you, only take grab or taxis. But the bills do add up. So started driving instead. It isn't even about how many people it is. It's mainly about common sense. People do not look or watch out for others, lots of cars/bikes on the wrong lanes. Lots of speed in a dense area. Lots of sneaking through traffics. ALSO, lots of drivers run away if they cause an accident due to them not wanting to take responsibility. So yea, I'd like my country to change for the better of the people. I do not want for me or anyone to get into horrific accidents. 

Get off your high horse being driven safely around the car and truly see. There IS a big problem with the infrastructure here. And the government needs concrete plan to change it. All it takes is everyone following suit for the better of society as a whole. Idealistic but one can dream"
"Honestly its not that bad and 80% of motorbikes follow the law and 90% of cars also follow it. As someone who drove cars for 13 years and cars and motorbikes in Vietnam for 6 then these are my recommendation. 
1. Lane discipline on highways (but even US cant do that)
2. Mobile phone use while driving
3. Dont enter the junction if u cant leave it, in the UK they paint yellow boxes on junctions, you cant stop your car there so you dont enter the junction if you can't leave it, even if u have green light. Here people see green light and they push forward, lights change and then they get stuck in the middle and thus we have grilidlock. Especially when it rains. Just sort it out first please."
"Whenever you’re on a motorbike compared to a car, you will always have higher traffic fatalities. Vietnam is built on motorbikes but cars are slowly taking over and traffic in the HCMC and Hanoi are feeling the effects. In ten year driving during traffic in those two cities will be unbearable due to Vietnams increase in vehicle purchases causing more congestion. The infrastructure isn’t built for cars. Motorbikes are the most cost effective and efficient means of transportation. It is beautiful how traffic works in a country with so few traffic lights. 

I’ve been to Thailand where the majority of transportation is cars with a minority of motorbikes and public transpiration which is superior to Vietnams. The traffic lights in Bangkok can take over 5-7 minutes. It can take you an hour to go halfway across town due to traffic when it’s normally 30 mins.  I couldn’t wait to go back to HCMC where even the worst jams you’re still inching along. Thai average speed is about 75% faster than Vietnam’s. I’ll do 50kph in vietnam and 80kph I’m Thai safely on the highway. The secret to driving safe in vietnam is to go slow enough to react to all the clueless drivers. Everyone has clueless moments including myself and that’s where the beautiful honking comes into play. I had two near crashes that honking could’ve solved."
"As a foreigner:

Congestion of traffic and time lost is really not that bad when you compare with many western cities, especially taking into account a population, less functional public transport etc.

Eg peak hours traffic in Warsaw are way worse than Hanoi IMO, especially compared to non-peak hours. It's just tourist mostly doesn't notice because old town is limited for cars/bikes etc. and you can still manage with public transport.

Still people love cars and they are less efficient than bike. Most cars here transport 1 or 2 people and taking into account everyone like SUVs.. way more space taken.

This applies for many European cities.

Obeying rules is a different beast and I don't think changes are possible without changing of driving culture (takes years) and changes to cities design (more years).

Motorways aren't that bad except people not noticing lanes, overtaking on left and trucks using VN priority rule (I'm bigger I have priority).

Cities are though. Mixing lanes is extreme. I notice to many people going left lane when taking the first exit on round about or going whatever lane they want and then turning right/left. A part of reason is that very often lanes are not marked enough, especially for turning.

Bikes also often go against the traffic direction if it's closer (just after landing I noticed people going left on roundabout).

There are more examples. But a least you aren't speeding that much which is usually responsible for deadliest casualties.

City design on the other hand is really American and car friendly. You can't be a pedestrian even if you want, including tourist districts (lack of pedestrian crossings with lights almost everywhere). Many places I visited had 1-2 too many lanes and according to most research more lanes doesn't reduce congestion, just make city for other worse (and looks uglier). Many big intersections also used just normal lights which is mistake for a left turn (no collision options, roundabout with lights or even no conflict left light for less busy ones are better solution)."
"I just returned from my second trip to Vietnam and I tell everyone that asks Vietnam driving is controlled chaos, but they are some of the best drivers to be able to handle that much congestion and what appears to be lawlessness"
"Tbh Vietnamese traffic is a part of exotic culture. If everyone drive the same as everywhere else, it lose a lot of charm. Anthony Bourdain loved to ride a bike and  join the chaos everytime the came to Vietnam"
"Lots of self hating Vietkieu or first gen Vietnamese immigrant in US/Canada/UK on Reddit. They love to agree with the expats and foreigners in criticism because they feel enlightened and worldly. 
That’s why you always see “the traffic so scary . People have no IQ here in dirty commie land. Commie is why they so low IQ in 2023” post with 100+ comments."
I mean i wouldn't be that bad if we had subway train
"I'll just leave this here...

"All I got to say is my opinion of cars is lowered every time I commute. I know planning our infrastructre was terribly handled but that doesn't excuse buses and cars to block every lane on the roads.

Say what you will about bikes but it takes significantly less time to resolve a situation involving bịkes and they don't take 20 seconds just to cross an intersection. They are also very cost efficient and low-polluting compared to cars.

Can't wait until I can take a train to work (Read: Another decade of waiting)"
Try commuting in Manila lol
"Well yes, chaos exist but except for little talk of a very few people, it seems that everyone is content with the situation. A situation where you drive your motorbike over the sidewalk and park in front of the door of the shop you intend to visit, where you drive your motorbike through the market place, where you drive your motorbike over the sidewalk to avoid a traffic light where you park you car in the bend or in front of an alley. I learned to live with that all. No complain as it is part of life in Vietnam. And yes, maybe after a long period, say 50 years or more, it will be more regulated. But instead of complaining one should adapt. 6000 accidents over Tet and 9000 deaths per year is the result of course of behaviour. The very good thing is that the law against alcohol in the traffic came into force and I am sure that the number of accidents will reduce tremendously. Apart from that, life is not bad in Vietnam."
"A short reply: All these issues will disappear over time. I have seen this happening in Singapore and in Hong Kong. Be patient, don't complain and in due time your dream has become reality."
"Hi. As a native, I wish more Vietnamese would be able to understand the law.  I absolutely agree that once you're behind the wheels, you would see things differently.  It is not about ""oh the roads are too narrow"", it is more about the mindset.  If people dont give a fuck about traffic laws now,  what's to say they will follow in say 10,20 or 30 years? Here are some examples:

- People (mostly motobikes because they are more mobile and thus can move quickly) drove past a red light when there is still like 30 seconds left.  I mean, are those guys meeting some VIP or they all have diarrhea? And please dont give the explanation of ""people need to move quickly"". Yes, I need to move quickly too but surely, cant you wait for 30 seconds? It is pretty disgusting when people drive like they are always about to have a diarrhea explosion; when they spend the morning wasting their time at coffee shop.  

- The lack of respect for pedestrians.  It absolutely infuriates me when I see a wide intersection without a lot of cars, people still drive past the zebra lines without yielding for pedestrians.  

- Driving on the other side (on a 2 way road).  I have no words for this.  Unless the roads are too narrow, but otherwise you have no excuse to drive on the other side.  

- People signal left to turn right, signal right to turn left.  I mean, I am proud of my country and the things that it provides.  But, this js just stupid. 


The mindset will be the same as it is now in 10 or 30 years.  I know we are just done with Covid, but the reaction to Covid vs. stupid drivings is just laughable.  During Covid, people were policing each other and remind to check in and wear masks.  Dont get me wrong, this is a very good thing ! Compare that to the driving situation, people still drive recklessly and dgaf about the laws, even if there are lots of deaths by traffic accident.  Fuck, a Taxi driver the other day told me dont bother to wear seatbelts (front seat) because you wont get into an accident at 30 kmph.  I reminded him that it is my choice to still wore it anyway.  

I think the traffic in Vietnam is becoming normalized, it is normal: 
- to drive the wrong way, 
- to drive past pedestrians like they arent there, 
- to immediately drive on the pavement on a wide road just because you cant wait another 10 fucking seconds for the green light.  

You walk around the street and saw sighs like: ""Dont drink and drive"", ""Drive in the correct lane is the role of every citizens"".  Or, there are traffic laws with A LOT of texts describing how you cant cross a tunnel at certain time.   It is laughable really.  Why cant we get the same judgement and policing we had with each other for the traffic situation?  When I was in the US, it is not the laws or the police that made me want to drive sensibly.  It is the feeling of shame that if I drive stupidly, people see this as abnormal and give me funny looks."
"As we are talking about laws, most drivers ed center in Vietnam only provide mnemonic devices, tricksters to answer the Theory questions in the Driving test.  Some examples include : ""if question starts with X and ask Y you always pick 4th choice"" to ""whenever you see X in question always pick the longest answer"".  So.... new drivers dont even need to know the laws in Vietnam and still pass."
Op is not saying that people need to take a taxi...
"80% and 90% is really low for following laws designed to keep people alive. 

20% of people breaking any other law would be a huge amount."
Just anecdotal but it's usually about two to three seconds before the lights go green that many people go on.
"The whole phone while driving thing is nuts. Chattering on the phone, text chat, or watching some videos in heavy two way city traffic with bikes, cars, buses, and trucks."
"There are definitely good and bad drivers *by Vietnamese standards*. A bad driver is, for example, somebody you see going over two big bumps (manhole covers) and only then realizing they need to dodge the third one, or who tries to weave through bikes but keeps failing. (This comment is entirely serious btw.)"
"Pretty sure the massive death toll from road accidents runs counter to the idea it's ""controlled chaos""."
"Ah not really,muscle memory and spatial awareness just kicks in .I lived in HCMC for 7 years driving on average around 1-1.5 hours a day to work/gym/football I've seen and also done some really stupid stuff.Problem is,someone elses lack of awareness puts you in a bad position on the road ,you might crash and they just drive on."
"It's all well and good when you're just visiting. When you need to do it every day, the novelty wears off."
Thanks but I prefer to have a working traffic system instead of being exotic to white people
Vietnam is #2 and only slightly behind Thailand for the number of traffic fatalities in SE Asia and in the top 25% globally.  Anyone that says traffic here is fine is a moron.
"
Being a self hating person or being enlightened or not has nothing to do with making observations about traffic. What the hell are you talking about?

As a foreigner I agree with op that the traffic is not that bad in Hanoi."
Everyone complains about traffic everywhere. There’s nothing self-hating about it. There are also a lot of natives agreeing with criticisms. It doesn’t mean they hate their country.
"Yeah, I hope so. The whole semi-enforcement of the 'wearing a helmet' thing really helped. If I see drunk driving drop in frequency over my lifetime, I'd be quite happy.

It's our nature for our reach to exceed our grasp. Of all of the ways we fail, this is probably the most noble. We'll get there eventually though!"
"> Be patient, don't complain and in due time your dream has become reality.

If you don't complain, why would anyone change anything? If you're silent about something, it's likely to stay like that forever.

I hope the public transportation system in Vietnamese cities keeps improving. It's barely okay in Saigon (and it suffers from weird prejudices, the buses are half empty most of the time) and basically non-existent in most cities. At the same time, people should be encouraged to use public transportation, these processes should go along together."
And who makes it disappear? Individuals. It changes because people want to change. It starts with each person. Admitting there’s a problem and wanting to change is what changes things. “Being patient” and “not complaining” but not doing a thing doesn’t change shit. And in the meanwhile thousands of people continue to die a senseless death every year.
It changes because people complain and because people start to back enforcing traffic laws. It's also worth thinking that a lot of the chaos would go away with obeying traffic laws.
isnt that what implied?
"I reckon after about 3  months the novelty is completely gone,after about 3 years its dread going out into evening rush hour traffic trying to get somewhere,no fun at all."
"Tourists seem to forget that Vietnam doesn't exist to be a ""fun place to hang out"".  Actual people with real lives live there and have to struggle every day."
"All traffic are bad, there is no big city with good traffic. Even in US, 6 lanes highway still jam. The only good traffic is no traffic at all, which is pedestrian / bike . Which require you working close to your house, or using public transport. Pubic transport is even worse than traffic."
"I’m saying every single slight inconvenience in VN is blown out of proportion with 5 more comments sucking each other off for being so observant.
That’s why there isn’t a week that there’s a top post about why life in Vietnam sucks because people just don’t know how to be civilized like the other great western metropolises. That’s the self hating part."
"no...what makes you think so? OP is just saying he uses a taxi

if anything, taking a taxi would make his ride SLOWER and he's still saying that he has no problem with the traffic"
"You either grow desensitised to the danger, or it begins to seriously bother you."
"then what does he mean by “if you find it difficult and feel negative about the traffic, why the heck are you driving in the city?”?"
Think he's saying avoid it entirely. Taking a taxi certainly won't avoid the traffic.
but he didn’t say “avoid”
"The stuff that really shocks me as an american is the injuries/scars everyone has from road accidents. 

Also the 5 person families fitting on one scooter going 50kmh. The sandles and brain buckets i sort of understand. 
The three toddlers napping on the median while thier mom begs for money is disturbing. 

Finally walking along a huge sidewalk with my son in a stroller but almost getting hit by motorbikes riding the sidewalk just pisses me off. Also somehow having to walk in the road because the huge sidewalks are packed with motorbikes drives me crazy.

Having to cross 12-14 lanes of traffic to get to the bus stop to work is also annoying. Somehow i end up taking a grab to cross the street."
"Vietnamese drive like they doesn't even give a damn about their life, especially teenagers, those mf ride their bike like crazies"
"I was in a passenger van travelling to Vung Tau. The driver was speeding and weaving through traffic. This old lady crossed the road not giving a fuck and the driver slammed on the brakes almost killing her. He didn't even care or said anything, he went on his speeding and weaving ways like it never happened."
"Compared to the West and East Asia (China, Korea, Japan), it's somewhat shitty. Compared to SEA, it's better than most."
I witnessed 2 life-threatening bike accidents in Hue in 1 week only. My taxi drivers were not even shocked. It was like Business-As-Usual for them.
"I live in Bangkok now moving to Vietnam soon, how do people feel the traffic compares to Bangkok?
In Bangkok the traffic is gridlocked a good portion of the time so that cars are barely moving, on the bike I've spent a lot of my time just going down the middle between the cars. On the large 8 lane roads in the city it can get very confusing and I've witnessed quite a few close calls because people don't know what they're doing and constantly switching lanes."
Wow who vote the first option must be some vinfast mfer on e-bikes. Every day at 17:00 the whole Ho Chi Minh City is a cluster fk. Y’all should stop complaining if y’all country has six-lane roads and sustainable highways.
"Comparison? Compared to developed countries, worse. Compared to Developing? Much better.

 Hell, we have better traffic than India. And they are...how do we classify them? Developed? Developing?"
Have 38 voters never been outside Vietnam?
"i've lived in VN for 18 years and 4-5 years in Australia. In Vietnam, on the first sign, the traffic is very chaotic. But when you're used to it, it's pretty controlled. The fact that you can cross the road with traffic running at you relatively safely every day shows that riders and drivers in Vietnam have enough reaction and skills like swerving or emergency stopping. And everyone knows riders on the right, and drivers on the left, which helps keep the traffic relatively safe by not mixing larger vehicles with small vehicles. Definitely not to say that Vietnam has the best traffic system in the world, with some ignorance ""racing bois"", ""trẻ trâu"", or ""ninja lead"" around, but it's ok.

Now compared to Australia where traffic is very controlled, i think it's too controlling with too many confusing rules, especially when you are riding/driving in the city area, that a new driver or even intermediate driver can be confused by the road markings and such. Traffic in Australia is pretty safe, but it can take only one mistake to make it into an emergency situation due to how fast the traffic can go in here and how impatience people can be here. Just yesterday i was riding on my motorcycle and a mtfk riding a car just cross an unbroken double line just right next to me just to overtake me. This is why they always teach in motorcycle riding school here to act like every car, truck drivers are blind and have no idea what they are doing."
It's fine. Anyone who drives in other developed Asian countries and se asian countries knows. Scooters in Vietnam are very disciplined compare to scooters in a more developed Asian country where people there just swerve left and right without looking in the rearview mirrors unlike majority of vietnamese. Anyone on the highway knows scooters stick to the right and cars stick to the left. Vietnamese drive 40 in a 60 or 60 in an 80 km per hr highway or 70 in a 100 km per hr. Plus road signs emphasize wear your seat belts or helmets. Anyone who says it's worse never seen other asian countries.
The same needed to be an option.
Meh it’s ok. No worse and no better than other similar countries. We adapt and everyone knows what’s going on at all times.
"It's definitely worse, but definitely more fun!"
"I won't really say whether its worst or better thats up to interpretation, all I know is...I wouldn't survive 5 seconds in it 😅"
"as not asian,  sometimes it's was scared as i driver, but after found out how all works it's ok. but still trying to be ad far as possible from lorry"
"It’s even worse during late night, especially in new developed estates where the roads are just completed and the police force is not usually present. Motherfckers from 14-5 years old to 20 years old on their modified scooter racing like it’s their own road. Not only it affects people living in that area but when they see people moving around the speed up so the engine will make loud noise as some kind of showing off. I only hope the police to arrest all of them because the same groups are the ones causing these large groups fighting with weapons or using drugs"
"Werd, the other day in Hanoi some kid was redlining it trying to get ahead in peak hour traffic... Like slow down dude, your going to kill someone or your self."
Was it a Hoa Mai van? I took one of those once and only once. Similar experience. Just mind-numbingly stupid decisions by everyone on that whole stretch of road.
"Bruh nearly everyone who drives/rides in Vietnam has this kind of close calls times and times again. It’s not like we going over the speed limit, it’s that A LOT of people drive UNDER the acceptable speed (like why would you only go 20kph in a 50kph road or 70kph highway) and the fact that most people jay-walk/ride the shit out the roads, crossing roads abruptly, not even looking then wonder why they got hit by a fucking truck and their insurance won’t cover it."
"At least the ""tre trau"" teenagers are not driving cars yet I think. Once Vietnam becomes more economically developed and income rises up, I'd absolutely hate to see them switching to cars and doing impromptu street racing. It'll be a disaster to say it lightly."
"Yeah but the comparison wasn’t to other Asian countries. It was to most other countries. The traffic here has always been a shitshow with selfish pricks who have little regard for those around them. The funny thing is that there’s seems to be little awareness of what actually is or isn’t dangerous. As an example, I used to live in D8 on Pham Hung. On the bridge to get there you would always see people stopped on the side, either chatting with each other, taking pictures, whatever. Nevermind the fact there is little room left for traffic once you’ve stopped a motorbike there. People were clueless as to why that might not be such a good idea. 

Then there’s the lane cutting, red-light running…you see it in other countries, but not daily like here."
Is this missing the s tag?
Disciplined?? Have you even been to Vietnam?
">Anyone on the highway knows scooters stick to the right and cars stick to the left. Vietnamese drive 40 in a 60 or 60 in an 80 km per hr highway or 70 in a 100 km per hr.

I can't comment on any other stuff having only driven cars and motorcycles in Vietnam, but this is pretty much dead on. Even on newly-built expressways such as CT01 and CT05, most cars will still drive 10-20 km/h under the speed limit."
"Yeah, I’ve never seen dead riders just laying on the pavement and no one giving a fuck in any other country. Seeing that twice in a span of a few months changed my mind real quick about how cool riding on Vietnam is."
Yeah that's technically a regular day in Vietnam!
Yes!!! The lux black vans.
They ride under the speed limit precisely because these sort of people who don't give a shit and just walk out the middle of the road.
"I drive 20 km to work and 20 km from work in an industrial infested area of vietnam. Vietnamese are more polite when driving compare to a ""more"" developed Asian country I drove in. Regardless, I felt more need of road-rage back home in a western country whenever I'm driving... (in a metro city). I feel western driving may follow rules but you got worse dicks there compare to Vietnam. What's funny is that the other day I still subscribe to another more developed more respected (?) Asian country social media group and they put a list out on stereotypical behaviors of those drivers which I can attest to -- driving there is more scary and I lived there for some years. Vietnamese are more polite in comparison."
"I'd say that he's being a little too optimistic about how motorcycle drives here, but half of it is actually correct. If you ever actually drive a car or motorcycle in the streets of Hanoi, you'd know what he is talking about. By Western standards, it's absolutely chaotic yes, but at least it isn't like Manilla and New Delhi I suppose."
"Live and drive here for the past couple of years. 23km to work and 23km back 6 days per week. Compare to other countries and home country...yeah, I stand by my words strongly. I know the behavior... they're more disciplined. By the way, I also know how to read and speak the language. There are more safety signs and cops being paid off is a good internal control activity...compare to another country I've lived in nearby... it's worse there and just last week, someone posted the stereotypical driving mindset of that other more developed country.i can attest to that."
"Exactly. In more developed Asian countries, cars drive fast and there are more road rage that I've witnessed. I've seen scooters in Vietnam being driven and yeah they can see you driving from behind when they veer a bit to the left side of the two lane road. You know vietnamese drivers are way more disciplined than in another asian country with a higher standard of living I lived in with lots of scooters and they got a death wish without realizing it. It's very black and white difference in all honesty. My family is huge and they have cars and scooters. I know how they drive...not crazy."
"That happens in every single other country too, Vietnam is no different. I’ve seen accidents and just drive by. If you stop it makes more chaos. Don’t rubberneck."
Buddy why are you commuting 20km to work?
"I think it's more like we drive more dangerously, but we acknowledge that we do so, and we don't like to get angry over small annoyance"
No… no it does not. I have lived many other places for longer periods and never seen it anywhere else. Being unable to admit that some things aren’t good just means they are still bad and will never get better so long as people maintain such blind attitudes.
"Most countries don’t have the same frequency of fatal accidents that Vietnam does, nor the law-breaking. To argue otherwise is drawing a false equivalence."
Actually 22.9 km one way. Because I'm not an English teacher; I just happen to have a real mcJob. A lot of Vietnamese even on scooters do travel that far for work. A lot.
Yeah that’s just it though. What you see as a small annoyance is probably considered wildly dangerous in most countries. Ever see 5 people on a motorbike here? 4? 3? A guy carrying 20 cases of beer strapped to his bike? There’s a reason tourists take pictures of things like that here.
Vietnamese don't drive angrily. Trust me. I've seen angry drivers in other countries and in another country nearby that's more developed and where road rages occur way too often.
"Not sure what a 20km, sorry, 22.9km commute has to do with being an English teacher or not."
"It's absurd, I agree."
I can see why you’re not an English teacher. Yikes.
"Bro it’s 22,9 kilometers distance. Bruh where do you live you even Metric?"
"Common sense, kid. There are plenty of English schools even in local small towns. If you're an English teacher, you make a shipload of money compare to even accounting managers and spend a lot on overpriced apartments and gorge yourself over bia and complain about traffic. You would not live so far from your place. I just happen to be one of those capitalist pigs instead with my own car that I personally drive."
Lol read the traffic accident and fatalities statistics and then get back to us about that awesome driving.
"In 2022, there were 11,450 vehicle traffic crashes, 6,384 ppl died, 7,804 ppl injured.
Every day, nearly 17 people die on the road"
"Hanoi is notorious for its chaotic traffic. Nobody wants to follow the rule even when they know they will contribute to traffic jam/accident, I’m confident that it has the worst traffic culture in the entire Vietnam"
"It's all fun and game till someone gets killed, man.

That or when you get stuck in a traffic jam during a down pour."
"Yeah it's cool to point and giggle at the freak show. It's another thing to be part of it. Constant stress, accidents everywhere. Everyone's vehicles are scuffed and damaged. Half the motorbikes don't have working lights and the other half can't be arsed to turn them on when it's raining or dark. Vietnam's terrible traffic is holding the country back."
"1. As many have mentioned, traffic accidents is very common, with high fatility rates.
2. If you compare Vietnam traffic to Thailand, Vietnamese actually generally drive a lot slower. Typically in Thailand, it is common to ride at 50 - 60km/h, but in VN, most people ride around 30-40km/h. So when you think about it, it's more like they are just all driving/riding slower while trying to ""maneuver"" lmao"
"Don’t you love the family of 4, where one of the kids up front is clearly less than 6 months old?


Those are my favorites, bonus points for when it’s that family and it’s dark out.


Speed limits are low compared to ours in the US and they generally abide by those slow speed limits so while it’s definitely nuts, once you realize everyone is going 22 mph it’s a lot easier to walk amongst the chaos."
"I have a morbid pride about finally being able to drive like a local. It took me many years of learning to strip myself of all logic, self awareness and caution. But now I can happily say that I like to get shit faced drunk and drive down the wrong side of the road at night with my lights off while watching porn on my phone, and obviously my children and I will not have helmets."
Lolling at the replies. Don't you dare say something positive about Vietnam in here.
"When I was in Vietnam I was wondering why there was so much honking.  Then I realized honking wasn’t the driver saying “fuck you!” Like it is here in America.  Honking was basically necessary!
 Because no one followed red lights or road lanes.  People swerved back and forth and even go against traffic.  No one stops at intersections and just plow ahead.  The honking was to notify all the other drivers that I’m next to you, or I’m not stopping or slowly down so you better get out of my way.  It seems like the biggest vehicle owned the road.  Everyone else got out of the way.  Our 16 seat van would plow through traffic and all the smaller taxis and mopeds would scurry to the side.  Then comes a huge tour bus and we had to swerve to the side.  Then a giant truck comes plowing through and the bus had to give way.  Quite the intricate dance."
"You aren’t seeing the accidents then, unfortunately."
"Why do you people romanticize this? For all the good things Vietnam has, this isn't one of them. People die and get injured all the time for something you see as ''chaotic harmony.''"
not that amazing when you see accidents happen so often
Vietnam has no freedom mfs when they visit Hanoi:
... road deaths are the one of the biggest causes of deaths here (number 1 preventable)
Driving 30 minutes in Vietnam is more tiring than 10 hours in the US or Europe
"Yeah right so cool. Also, just about every local has some scars (many huge ones) due to accidents."
Partially correct observation and fucked up conclusion.
It's just not your turn yet... One of the friend's family member just got ran over by a commercial truck because she was stopping at the red light. Stay safe out there!
"How do most accidents happen? Who is at fault?

I want to move to hcmc next march but all the talk of driving fatalities is turning me off"
"Yeah come back with that awe when you check the road death stats, and then add another 20% of unreported deaths as a consequence of that amazing driving.  


Then join some vietnamese ""idiocy watch"" pages and marvel more at how local idiots think going through red lights and getting hit by a car is a cultural norm, or when one of these intelligent morons decides they are immune to being hit by a train."
"As I've been learning to drive a bike in Hanoi I too am in awe , like entering junctions on the wrong side of the road into the oncoming traffic is the expected rule. Especially if your carrying 18ft lengths of steel on a trolley onto the main road.. what truly amazes me though is the old ladies cycling at 2mph straight through the heart of a junction crossing all lanes as if they are in a dreamworld without a care in the world it's like they are still living in the 50s or something. I didn't particularly like a tre trau driver speeding into me while I was walking across the road , broke x4 of my ribs and sent my body flying about 15 ft down the road like a ragdoll. Yeah Vietnam is amazing but that's why everyone keeps dying I'm afraid,  I'm starting to think it's not anything to be proud of and it's hampering their economy as none of the traffic can actually drive at any speed because of the constant hazards. I guess there is no place quite like it in the world yeah"
"I was in HCM for a month and lost count of how many serious road accidents I saw. A truck carrying a ladder that brought down cables that clotheslined two women on a scooter , a young guy on a motorbike that had lost control at speed and crashed into a busy cafe, trucks on their sides, it was astonishing."
"Well, in 2022 there were 11450 traffic accidents which killed 6384 and injured 7804 people."
"Happy to hear that you enjoy the ""harmony"". Curious how it going to feel like when you are one of the 10 people die daily on the roads, or one of the hundreds crippled for life."
"Been living and driving in HCMC for the last 3 years and I have developed some weird traumatic responses now to the sight of people almost having accidents because I've seen atleast 2 people dying on the road and many more accidents happen in real time in front of my eyes just feet away from me.
I do love driving here and I'm generally a very hard person but I've seen enough for it to have affected me.
I work with someone who's 4 year old sun was struck and killed by a truck while on his way home.
Drive safely out there."
"easily impressed, wait till you see hcmc traffic"
"Yea, it not very amazing at all. The traffic in ha noi is driving me up the wall. It wear you down little by little if you are native. Hanoi is thriving, yes but the road  infrastructure is shit. No sidewalk anywhere, we still got a long way, the only upside is our driving skill and our spider sense to detect traffic cop."
Be safe and enjoy!
Hanoi =/= the rest of Vietnam
I read somewhere there are more traffic deaths a year than the entire Vietnam war
"Imagine before traffic lights and westernized ways, picture motorcycles as the affordable option for transport. This is a post war poverty stricken country that had destruction not long ago. Thank you OP, it's what they have and it works till things get better. 

As an American living here, I don't know who these people are commenting but I sure as hell hope they aren't Vietnamese that grew up here. If they are Vietnamese abroad, stop being an entitled piece of shit."
I feel like the safest time to be in traffic in Hanoi is when it’s too crowded for people to go fast
"I can't say anything for HCMC, but aside from a few specific things that make traffic terrible on occasion, the organic, rule-bending, flow of Hanoi traffic is brilliant! Any grandma can ride her bike across the street and be totally safe (though she will likely cause 20 collision close-calls to motorbikes behind her). Kids walking along the street also appear to be safe from harm. Drivers generally watch out for bikes and pedestrians. 

Once you adapt, the organic flow around obstacles and through intersections is the closest thing a human will experience to mermeration-- the collective-consciousness, synchronized flow that happens in schools of fish or swarms of swallows. And going through red lights when it's clear is so much more efficient overall.

The few things that wreck it all: 

1) The jackasses who steal the right of way and run red lights that aren't clear, causing 40 people to be set back for the selfish personal gain of 1. 

2) Piling up on the left/wrong side of the road at train stops. Guaranteed gridlock every time. This is one of the places where I would be stoked if 40 cops descended for lunch money systematically on drivers that create gridlock. 

3) Turning right abruptly from the left hand side of the road or turning left abruptly from the right side of the road. I will never understand this suicide/homicide tactic.

4) Big cars, even though cars only seem to make about 10% of the traffic, everything would be so much better if it was only motorbikes. (Grab cars, delivery trucks, public transportation, or construction and emergency vehicles excused)"
"Not sure what's so awe inspiring.  Driving is different here in Vietnam because it has to be.  In the US, I can drive fast, turn suddenly, etc.  Here, driving must be slow, deliberate, and no sudden erratic movements.  There is a method to the madness but it requires quite a bit of adapting, whether you're driving a car, on a motorbike or even bicycle.  It's mote dangerous than it needs to be but things generally work well because most people play by the rules."
"Feel the force, Luke."
"Mỗi thành phố có trật tự riêng trong sự hỗn loạn ấy, tôi đi chơi vài tỉnh thành khác và nhận ra điều này, tuy nhiên là người Việt thì tôi có thể quen trong vòng 30'. Chúc vui vẻ nhé. Còn nhiều điều thú vị hơn là giao thông đấy."
To be fair i was absolutely In awe of American driving. I'm from the UK.
Six legs? Those are rookie numbers in Thailand and Cambodia my dude.. I have seen three small children and mom and pop on a scooter in Thailand on several occasions.
"They drive slow comparatively. I hate bangkok speed for instance. But soo many bad drivers. You need a solid few months after the ' fun ' period. Selfish, careless and inconsiderate on the road. Just roll with it or lose your mind. Im the former"
"I got my car driving license with maxed points few years ago and I was shocked to realize how crazy good drivers in my area are - it's Northen area of the country with very tricky narrow roads that curl around the mountains and hills with high slopes and mountain passes that can give those people from plain areas who fist time visit here heart attack.

But the lack of safety and obligation to traffic rules is real and very dangerous especially with motor drivers. Car drivers are generally have way better skill, have better understanding and follow the rules, they generally afraid of motor divers too"
"There's 2 ways to drive in Vietnam street: ""I'M FUCKING IMMORTAL BABYYYY!"" and ""yeah, i'm gonna wait for 30s more instead"". No between"
"Strange. Saigon seems more safe and everybody stops at red lights, drive 20 km/hr less than speed limits. There's a reason: none want to shell out 20 bucks to traffic cops, especially if income is 350 bucks per month."
"Ha noi huh, you should try Sai gon driving and trafic 😏😏😏😏"
"It seem like there is only one rule.  If it's in fernando you, it's your responsibility to not hit it.  Whatever you're ahead if is not your problem."
Crossing the street and expecting everything to swim around you like a school of fish is a form of faith not everyone has.  The #1 thing I recommend to tourists is to pay for a bike taxi ride through a busy part of Hanoi.  It's better than a roller coaster ride for thrills and exhilaration.
"Bruh I have a vivid memory of visiting my family in VN when I was 12 (from US) and they took me around on a scooter 

I’ve never felt more like I have ptsd"
Welcome to the jungle man
That’s one thing Vietnam is known for! Organized chaos!
I am from America and rented a 150cc motorbike in HCMC and drove to Nha Trang and back. Absolutely nervous for the first day but got the hang of it quickly. Great time!
It takes 45 mins to go 5km due to the traffic. This is why you need to follow traffic rules
Drink 1 litre of Jack Daniels and your driving skill will be on par with the Vietnamese.
"You get used to it pretty quickly. I saw a kind of similar thing with cyclists in the Netherlands haha. A lot of people in VN do drive like shit tho, like some people just have zero regard for other people’s lives. Mixed bag, some suck some don’t, but the “water” style remains"
Chaotic order is right!
"Embrace the chaos, unleash the power 💀"
Lol
"I used to be terrified of the driving on the highways (travelling on tourists buses around the country - I would go by train when possible) but then I was driven by a full-time driver from Da Lat back to HCMC, and I too became full of respect. It takes skill to avoid other cars by centimeters, and flit in and out of a line of cars with oncoming traffic. We might not do it in other countries because in many cases we don't need to, and without practice it really is terrifying, but without skill it is deadly."
tự nhục gang assemble
Stay away from trucks toward the outside of the city at night. Often underage drivers.
"satire? everyone drives as if they are the only ones on the road, high beam lights, turning on right hand signal to go left (not forgetting to turn it off), passing you every time they get even if the chance of them crashing into you is 70% chance, never using mirrors, etc, out of all the asia countries i’ve visited the worst driving is here"
"I absolutely love Vietnam but at the end of the day I think it’s important not to glorify what are absolutely terrible driving standards. Vietnamese roads *are* dangerous and the risk of an accident or death remains very high

Vietnamese roads being at total chaos is not only dangerous but it disproportionately affects vulnerable people like the elderly and children, and has economic productivity costs. A big reason for it is also the dire state of public transit in the country meaning a private motor vehicle is needed to get anywhere.

Motorcycles being used as all forms of transportation is also something that seems cool but ultimately is the result of the country still being quite poor and very unequal. At the end of the day, cars are safer and more comfortable than motorcycles, while for big cities public transit should be available. The fact that neither are options for so many Vietnamese is something that needs to change."
"I found it’s kinda interesting that the traffic rules in Vietnam are not really the ‘rule’ but more like the ‘guide’. It doesn’t matter if you don’t follow the rule as long as you not being caught by the police. One more thing is that I only honk if there was an idiot driving but in Vietnam, sometimes honking means they want to tell you they are coming. Pretty cool hey?"
"It's surprisingly safe in the city.

But high fatalities in the country side where ppl travel at higher speed."
"Send help. 

I fear for my life everyday."
"Idk man, everyday I go outside, I just pray to the gods that a bus won't hit me"
"Are there a lot? Yikes 😬 I was in awe of them too tbh, and maybe I'm just lucky? Since I've never seen a single motorbike accident for my whole year living in Hanoi. 

Actually, I can imagine the possible density of an accident in VN, it could be a chain of motorbike accidents due to its numbers. But I heard that the ""racing boys"" is heavily punished in VN, especially Da Nang? That even the locals hate them."
"This is the correct response.

It's all fun until somebody gets permanently injured or dies. And it happens all the time."
"I remember seeing the traffic for the first time. I know the accident and fatality rate are pretty high. But from the perspective of a westerner, it's amazing to us that it works at all. We come from countries with very strict traffic laws. When someone doesn't comply with those laws then, more often than not, there's a collision. If it happens on a freeway then somebody dies. To us, seeing Vietnam traffic for the first time is like watching beautiful chaos. It's like watching leaves swirling in the wind. It's like watching a massive group of starlings flying in beautiful synchronization. There is no ""master control"", yet it still flows like water. And yes, we have a tendency to credit the skill of the drivers for the wonderful ballet we see in front of us.

The awe is somewhat tempered the first time you see the aftermath of a ""semi"" that collided with a delivery truck, and you realize that unrecognizable mess used to be someone's brother, someone's husband, someone's father. One of the beautiful starlings has fallen to earth, and it's heartbreaking.

My wife's sister lost one of her sons in a traffic accident in Hue. It happened between my fifth and sixth trip to Vietnam. I'd spent hours chatting and drinking with him. When my wife and I got engaged he was at our Dam Hoi party. I'm still in awe of the traffic in Vietnam, but I understand there's a cruel reality behind the facade."
"On average? Still fewer fatalities than the US, even adjusting for population size."
Thailand is even worse deaths and they have more strict rules on the road.
"It's a double edged sword though. Vietnamese drivers would make amazing American drivers simply because they are much more able to improvise. Put them in an environment where everyone actually follows rules and they're much better. If youve ever driven in the US, some people are so rigid that they end up slowing everyone else down out of sheer unwillingness to improvise. It's maddening"
I love seeing meat crayons.
Same range per capita as Malaysia and Brazil. In the USA is half of that
"Saigon seems borderline peaceful in comparison while still also being very bad.

Traffic colorblindness is REAL in Hanoi holy crap."
"I always like to drive with my blinkers on to make sure that they stay in working order. I turn the left one on when I'm going from the house, and then turn the right one on whenever I come back to the house."
"Com’on.  It’s bad, but not the “half of them” bad. People are exaggerating the truth too much"
"Vietnam, where it's only worth buying nice things if you can afford to replace them quite often! (I actually like this though, as it has steered me away from the impetus to waste money on expensive clothes or bikes.)"
"Ở đâu mà tai nạn khắp nơi vậy, nếu bạn thấy nhiều vậy thì bạn thật sự không may mắn rồi."
"Maybe it is holding the country back, but it fun regardless.  
The stress's only there when you have not learned the rules."
dont forget 0 helmets
"Almost like a local , you're  not smoking a ciggy . Or perhaps you are and it's just second nature so you forgot to include in the skillset measurement. Lol"
"Vietnam has many things to be proud of, the fucked up and increasingly dreadful traffic is definitely not it.

The idiots are migrating to cars now!"
"Lots of positive things about Vietnam, driving is not one of them"
Got a link to these idiocy pages ? I'd love to have a watch
"The adrenaline of the holiday, the feeling of adventure, the awareness it’s not their life."
"I've seen more dead or mangled drivers here than I care to recount, and that is just daily commuting in HCMC. It really is mentally exhausting. I didn't realize how much so until I was driving back home during a holiday and it is just night and day.  I've had my fair share of near misses due to idiots and it gets tiring. 

Almost dying once a year in traffic isn't 'harmony' and it definitely isn't indicative of a properly working system. 

The traffic is one of my only gripes about living in Vietnam because it all just seems so asinine and self inflicted."
Hanoi is exponentially worse than hcmc for traffic.
"Native Viet here, over the last 25 years of life I have seen no less than 8 mangled corpses within sight from my home due to traffic accidents, 3 were young children. That may not sound like alot, until you scale it up from a relatively peaceful town in Central Vietnam to an entire country of dozens of millions. 


Now I don't want to tell you what to think, but I would very much appreciate not using our past struggles to try and justify a very real and dangerous lack of traffic safety in my country."

"About the racing boys thingy, they’re common, especially in the outskirts. I do see them roaming in busy streets in hanoi however."
In fact if u have a traffic radio channel u can hear real time news update about traffic accident like every other day 😓
"This is not true. 

Vietnam has 29.81 deaths per 100,000 while America has 12.9."
"Now adjust for vehicles and miles driven.  It’s not even close, Vietnam is way worse."
"People drive in a way lower speed in crowd, so I won't doubt if their fatality rate isn't too high. It will be really difficult to die in a car at 15mph. Unless involving motorbikes."
"what? are you dumb?   


go check the figures, vietnam has terrible stats and its down to the stupidity and selfish nature of people.   
I lost a friend and his wife due to an inconsiderate mofo doing overtake on blind bend. thats the culture, mememe."
nobody eve drives on the wrong side of the road there or pulls out in front of you!
"What I see on a daily basis: people making hard turns without looking back or signalling. People just entering the road with their vehicle without any regard for cars and bikes that are already on the road. People who need to turn left (for example) staying on the far right side of the road until the very last moment, and then wading their way through chaos to make that turn instead of preparing for that left turn a few hundred meters in advance. From what I see, it's not about rules or no rules. It's a complete lack of common sense and self preservation on the roads here. That wouldn't make for ""amazing drivers"" anywhere 🤷🏼‍♂️"
"Vietnam is probably significantly worse than Malaysia and Brazil as the VN health authorities don’t include deaths from injury complications after an accident as a road traffic death which artificially deflates their numbers

Anecdotal but I’ve travelled across all 3 countries extensively and there’s no way VN roads are on par with those in Brazil or Malaysia, so this qualifier makes sense."
"Traffic accidents don't only happen often ""in some specific areas""."
Or when you're one of the thousands of people killed or hurt every year or course. Pretty 'fun'.
I have Vietnamese friends who moved to Saigon and won’t drive there because of the terrible traffic habits. Taxis all the way despite the cost. They seemed pretty stressed.
"I've been twice to Vietnam. Now and 10 years ago. The first thing I noticed is how disruptive the automobile mix is. 10 years ago, it had a fluidity to it.  Now, the scooters just take up the empty spaces."
"Do you understand the dynamics of it though and impact on in infrastructure? Countries pushed back by war, other ones gain power, money and control. Government powers put into place purposely in third world countries for the benefit of first. 

It takes a lot of taxes, industries and government investments to build roads and traffic lights. In third world countries this is called soft lending power. In South America do you know who is putting in roads and traffic lights to developing countries? China is, and they will pay in debt to it. 

Like I said, it's not ideal, but you need to really understand the dynamics of this world before comparing this place in a negative manner. Idk if your native or not. This comment goes to my heart and blood in central America the same way. People are doing the best they can here till things get better."
"Well, as a tourist I think I'd be dead too if I drive in VN. Not skillful enough to drive in here. 😅 but thanks for the link though! Informative!"
Nobody in the government cares obviously. Human life is just a data point.
Where did you get that number from?
"Just a note that we should be checking it per 100k motor vehicles or per 1B miles driven if we’re looking at road safety

But yeah Vietnamese roads are incredibly dangerous and it’s something that needs to change not be glorified"
"Have you considered that US urban planning is the reason Americans have to drive much larger distances than Vietnamese people in the first place? You can essentially cheat the per mile accident rate if you make the average drive to work 30 km, which is essentially what the US has done here."
"Sure but a whole lot of American drivers in America are afraid to cross a solid white line even though sometimes the situation might warrant it. It's like waiting for the light to change before crossing the street in the middle of the night...when literally no one is around. I see this kind of rigid rule following all the time on roads in the US. Some US cities don't have a traffic problem in terms of volume, they have traffic flow problems. 


There's a middle ground and personally I still believe that it would be easier to make a chaotic driver follow rules than the other way around."
must be a million people like him there
"A totally standard scenario is two big suvs trying to both squeeze past two haphazardly parked suvs. Holding up the entire alley from both ends. 

Thanks cars."
"Your making the issue out to be completely  first world countries fault,, like regardless how or who is responsible, the roads are laid the traffic lights are in but you still have 60 million motorbikes driving randomly without proper coordination. The infrastructure is here,  just a proper driving test and a system of rules need to be followed and enforced which is not the responsibility of those first world countries. It's a big task and I hope Vietnam can overcome it soon"
It's not even that much about traffic light if many refuses to even follow it in the first place
"Very good point about it being a learned skill. In my experience, the difference is that in Vietnam the motorbike operator is responsible for not hitting anyone, regardless of if they cut them off or not. Similarly, motorbikes don't have the expectation that if they maintain their lane and the legal speed and obey traffic lights that they have nothing to fear. 

You'll notice buses follow a different set of rules, large trucks may also. Might makes right."
"there is no skills required.   
the whole basis of driving/riding here is ""mememefirst""  


e.g. if a driver/bike makes a mistake, wrong turn, not check mirrors, wrong way down road. their expectation is that everyone else has to adjust or go around them.  


dont be in awe of what is essentially stupidity and inconsideration for others. 

you will notice in hanoi especially idiots just go through red lights, kids on board or not, they will do it."
World Health Organization
"You realize how the suburbs came about, right?  Developed built homes outside of cities and sold them.  People bought them because they liked them, commute and all."
People drive them like they are motorbikes.
"Well that is a good point, you can build it all as detailed as you want but if no one follows the rules it won't matter. We have a good amount of traffic lights in Da Nang, people stop and go but it seems they didn't take the turning left into consideration and that's the biggest cluster about it."
"Yes, that's true. As I observed here, most of the motorbike drivers don't overspeed and they're all defensive drivers. It's probably because of their long time experience plus that's the norm of driving here. 

It's very different in my home country, and I feel safer here tbh. I never rode any motorbike riding services in my home country, but here I always do and I really enjoyed it."
"I've been in one accident in Vietnam, and that's due to being in the far left of the lane about to turn into a stores parking area, and someone speeding tried to pass me on my left in the oncoming lane (never anticipated this due to ingrained habits from driving in the USA, will definitelybe more careful on future visits)

Sadly, despite him being in the wrong, as a foreigner, i ended up paying him a hundred bucks or so for vehicle repairs and medical expenses just to get the police out of my hair since it was a few days before my flight home."
My favorite discovery was rush-hour-sidewalk-motorbikes when I was a pedestrian. Need another lane? Just jump up on the sidewalk.
"Sorry let me correct it. *awe in some or most* 


Maybe because I'm in the business district in Hanoi that's why I didn't feel it? And at the same time, most of my local friends/coworkers whom I ride with drives really well. What I like about them is their defensive driving, and doesn't go over 60kph. And they hate aggressive driving too, which is very common in my country. 

I experienced the same in grab motorbike and usually an  almost 2 hour drive going to the airport. Like no one is watching us and we're on a long wide road with very few cars but then most of the motorbike drivers stay at 60kph. 😨"
"Did some further digging. I stand corrected. It seems like official figures are under-reporting deaths, mostly by not reporting deaths that occur after the incident due to complications from injuries. But the WHO also admits that it's not that sure about its figures either, without access to official goverment stats, the best it can do is to use related figures, including (but not limited to) GDP, number of vehicles owned, miles of roads, access to health services, and percentage of motorbikes."
"That's an extremely simplified and somewhat misleading description of how American car dependency came to be, but yes, people bought houses in the suburbs, commute and all, so they're exposing themselves to more risk by driving further distances for longer.

How is that relevant to my comment about the US having a higher traffic fatality rate, exactly? Of all the factors that influence the safety of a country's infrastructure, such as road quality, intersection design, enforcement of traffic regulations, etc., surely *urban design*, which influences how long your citizens need to stay on the road to participate in society, must be a factor that is considered? Why should we intentionally ignore it by using the per-mile-driven accident rate, rather than the actual accident rate?"
"Yikes hopefully nothing serious happened to you too that time.

This is what I want to avoid too. For simple traffic violations, usually the police will just let it slide due to language barrier. But if there's a local involved, even if you're not in the wrong, they can still do this to extort money.😨"
"Yeah, a bunch of beeps you'll hear when you walk slowly on the sidewalk lol"
"Yeah I wouldnt expect a single party run country would be that transparent regarding traffic deaths (especially if it's a terrible ratio). 

However if they had a better ratio than the USA you could bet that they would share the data."
"30 deaths per 100,000 is low enough. I'll take my chances and wait for a better public transport system in 5-to-10-year time. Let's hope that it comes through."
"It’s not misleading when the narrative is “nobody wants suburbs, they all really want to live in dense urban cores and take transit, suburbs were forced on them”

And yeah, they accept the commute and all, including the risk of driving more and being in a fatal crash.  The risk is so minimal that most people are fine making the trade off"
"I stayed up because 3 people on my bike and i wasnt moving, he fell and skinned his arm a bit but nothing serious.  Both scooters were damaged a bit."
But the majority ride scooters. By far scooters outnumber cars. Over 1 million scooters in hcmc alone. If they all drove cars like in the usa it probably would be thousands of deaths per.
That leap in logic is quite a sight to see. :))
Truely annoying and frustrating people to deal with. And they will likely blame you instead
I’m glad you saved the guy on the motorbike by pausing the video. This could’ve been bad
"As a taiwanese I would say things will improve over time.
Taiwan and Vietnam suffer more or less from the same traffic problem, but as more people getting higher education and become more civil, as well as some political activist advocating for better traffic law and policy, the situation has become a lot better these days."
"Without consequences? Unlikely! 

Check this [shit](https://youtu.be/gflDXwKvg7g) out!"
"why is the driver going almost 50km/h in a small street like that

VN car drivers are either going entirely too slow or blazing by way too fast with little inbetween."
"I loved when I'd be walking down the sidewalk on a one-way street and someone would honk at me so they could drive in the opposite direction of the traffic, on the sidewalk.

Them: ""Honk honk [get out of the way]""

Me thinking: How about you drive the extra 2 blocks instead of endangering both of our physical safety?

That's just the tip of the iceberg.  It's also the one plus side of so many areas with messed up sidewalks: they can't go fast on the sidewalk.

Vietnam wants to be a developed nation, but traffic and litter and other things show that many people won't accept that they have an obligation to others in the community, and that they're harming the progression towards being a richer, more developed economy.

I think part of the problem is the lack of distinction between civil police and the military.  In Western nations, having the military do civil policing is prohibited in almost every situation.  In Vietnam, it's how things work.  Don't trust the military to do civil work; the training and job requirements are (or at least should be) completely different."
The older 35+ people 😂
Nope
Nope my friend
"Truth be told, most VN think traffic in their country is essentially fine. So do the authorities. Basically, nobody has a real incentive for VN to fix its traffic culture."
"I had a small revelation the other day. Mostly to do with the cars. I realized that, as annoying as the motorbikes can be, at least we understand it a little more and can maneuver around them more easily. The cars, though? 

It's my impression that the average new car owner here is in their 30's or 40's, and it's likely the first time they've driven. I've seen cars tie up an entire road because they didn't think they could drive through a narrower space (they totally could) and then I realized. They likely have no idea about the spatial requirements of their vehicle. 

The cars are constantly driving down the middle of the road, leaving very little safe space for the motorbikes coming from the opposite direction. I simply started sticking out my left hand and waving them over to their own side. They get over 95% of the time. I don't ever get over for them, but will slow to a crawl until they get the message. They aren't used to this, they're used to thinking they can overtake the entire road because they are in a vehicle, and that most motorbikes will get out of the way for them. Those of us on motorbikes need to start standing our ground (safely), and send them the message that there are two lanes, they cannot bully everyone out of the way, and they need to learn the actual spatial requirements of their vehicles."
A lot of these guys get smushed under trailer wheels.
"I do notice that a lot of these are from the older people like in the 35+ range. There are younger people too but either most of them are either stupidly reckless or just comply to the laws.

So as the older generate stops participating in traffic, there will prob be more civilized traffic.

Unless the police decided to ramp up on traffic patrol to lessen these types of small hazards, it have been done with drunk driving and wearing helmets and they have been largely successful. It will def be harder to get rid of these kind of uncivilized actions since it depends more on individual's attitude, but it will prob get rid of a decent amount of those actions.

My city Haiphong has been ramping up patrol on the street and people basically became more obedient with the traffic laws, sometimes all it really takes is a bit of pressure."
"This is the cost of corruption bro. Don't blame the player, blame the game. Traffic cops don't do their jobs to enforce the law but only looking to make money gives you this."
"Mate, its a one lane street each way. Cars illegally parked on both sides. it should be 40km/h and below. Where are you rushing to?"
I bet $100 a local person couldn't drive 1km without breaking the law at least once. In a car or a motorbike.
Its all about defensive driving.  Same thing happens in the US on 2 lane roads.
"one of the highest motor vehicle fatality rates on earth. you're doomed in places like hn/hcm, where you'll bleed out long before an ambulance arrives. perpetual traffic, motorists who don't yield to lights/sirens, etc.

so you end up being stuffed in the back of a taxi, sustaining additional injuries in the process, and taken to the nearest hospital with a chance of being butchered.

the number of people i've met with permanent injuries is astounding. a direct result of incompetency or lack of medical infrastructure/tech.

enjoy a lifetime of pain, or loss of a limb because 35k street food is KewL and the pPL r NiCe."
"Don’t expect people to organically know better over time. Unless there are material physical consequences, people don’t change."
Probably a VERY long time
"Since instilling civic sense takes a lot of years. Best option is government imposing strict fines and jailing for serious traffic violations, though this is an extreme approach, but it will save a lot of lives and reduce undue stress on drivers."
"Okay so this is what I learnt from Vietnam traffic. Turn out only Hanoian driving and riding like crazy, in other place people quite cool with traffic law. This could be because of how crowded Hanoi is and if you obey the traffic rules others people always take advantage of you. That's why people in Hanoi riding and driving like that (yes, both cars and bikes). But strangely people in HCM city are more orderly even though both place are super crowded."
"Nah its quite as daily as the sunset and rise, you can't change the mindset of Viet people who traveling around on their vroom vroom when they are not highly educated and fun fact that the amount of people who are being killed by guns crime in America even lower than the amount of people dying of crash in Vietnam, annually"
I swear these people think they're still living in the 1990s
The stupid one gonna die off eventually
47 km/h in urban area isn't the wisest thing to do either...
"South Vietnam was civilized, until 1975. Since then, the whole country has become a giant Commie shithole that everyone wanted to leave if given the opportunity. Even the Vietnamese Commie government officials have been sending their kids overseas, but only to the West which they constantly trashed, and never to the Commie paradises (China, North Korea) which they constantly glorified, at home to brainwash the enslaved population."
Spend any amount of time in hospitals across Vietnam and you’ll see. It’s carnage to the full degree.
No hope
"The court system needs to enforce traffic laws. When they start making people on bikes pay when they cause a crash, regardless of whether they cashed into an 18-wheeler, then traffic will improve."
Vietnam lacks law and order. I was trying to walk from my apt to a local pho spot 4 blocks away. kind of hard to do that when there are bikes going on the sidewalk every 10 seconds. they look at you like wtf are you doing on the sidewalk. cops need to start giving out tickets.
"On a scale of India on one end, and Japan on the other... Vietnam feels a lot more like India and I wonder which direction they're heading (with traffic, pollution, etc.).  Really disappointed with the lack of walkability on sidewalks and all the littering: reminds me of India."
It's at least gotten a lot better vs when I lived there 5 years ago. It almost felt like a successful emergent system from entropy at this point.
"Indonesia, Vietnam and Philippines traffic will never change."
Never.
Then I’m back here in the United States and we just had a truck driver stab a motorcyclist for letting too people many people take a left turn. It seems like you guys don’t have the road rage we have in the US.
Where is this street?
Didn't think i'd hear dire straits in this sub
what happened next? show the rest please
Didnt know Vietnam has similar traffic problems with my country (Philippines)
No.
"I'm in Vietnam for the first time at the moment. I assumed that the people driving like lunatics had some kind of mad skills, situational awareness and reflexes that let them drive so dangerously and get away with it. Then yesterday I saw an absolutely ridiculous and very easily preventable accident between two scooters and realised that they really aren't as skilled as I'd been giving them credit for."
Lmao hahahahahahaha it to cry laughing at the idea of Vietnamese civilized traffic
"You forgot about merging into traffic my turning right or left with out looking 
They use the horse with blinders approach and they dare to run them over"
"I see Vietnamese learning about road rage tactics more and more :) 

  
My new personal fave is the veering 45 degrees towards the pavement to cut off anyone trying to pass!"
">Will Vietnam ever become civilized in traffic

Not anytime soon. We are naturally born narcs."
"Lmao never
You will just get more motorbikes and more cars on ever worsening roads until it becomes Jakarta and you need 3 hours to go 5km"
never
"I actually found it refreshing when I visited this past month compared to the US. Not a lot of angry, honking, type A drivers there. If I tried crossing the street here in the US as I did there, I’d have been run over in a second! Drivers there will just go around you."
"I would say that traffic lights weren't a thing 20 years ago. Now it at least exist in HCMC. In the smaller cities, not as much."
The only answer is no.
"Traffic in Vietnam is indeed an annoyance, especially when you cannot get familiar with it or you're using a bicycle, people always cross when there are red lights, driving recklessly and much more, a potential danger to the community.. There aren't even traffic cops in certain parts of the city, which makes the problem even worse!"
"Without common human sense, proper education and consequences? Pretty unlikely in the near future."
"Just be glad we haven’t invented flying cars and bikes yet!

It’s a crazy but how do you solve such an ingrained wide spread issue"
"Do you have a Vietnamese license? Or, like the rest of us, did you drive without one, before now complaining about not following the rules?
Also, ever driven on the sidewalk or skipped the lights? Be honest"
"Oh shut the fuck up, this Reddit is full of people who want Vietnam to be like America. 
Vietnam is good this way, learn to like the chaos."
"I don't get it, you see that in the US all the time. There are douches everywhere you go."
"Dude, the Brits still drive on the wrong side of the road, what hope does Vietnam have?"
The mindset of “i always right and you always wrong” 😂
Slowly reverse speed and calmly drive away 😑
"I think what really helps is investing in both negative reinforcement (punishing offenders with fines), education (educational campaigns to teach right behavior in streets) and positive reinforcement (maybe a public policy to lower insurance costs for people who behave - this needs to be advertised extensively too). There's a need to combine these three aspects and then over time, people's conditions will improve.

Another thing to consider is work conditions. A lot of reckless behavior is related to short delivery deadlines or low wages, which sometimes forces people to speed up in order to generate more revenue for themselves. This needs to be tackled as well. This will be increasingly more problematic with the growth of gig economy and app platforms."
"Taiwan also has a far superior public transport system than Vietnam, that's also probably why it's lessened there."
"Same thing with China. First time I went to China was about 15ish years ago. Everybody was honking. Traffic coming in every single direction.

Went back a few months ago and it was much more civilized. Not as much chaos.

I think vietnam will get there eventually."
Dude Taiwan and Vietnam are not comparable. Come on now
"In the same vein, vietnam 15 years ago makes today look like the most organized traffic in the world. It was pure chaos back then"
"Unfortunately, in the recent years, the traffic in Vietnam is getting worse and worse, especially in Hanoi where I live. People run the red lights at every single intersection. Reckless drivers are everywhere.

I have no faith in it getting any better soon."
Wtf why the attitude towards the guy he roped into the accident. Fucking hell. Bro knocked himself over to not crush that fucker's balls as well.
Driver filming isn't exactly being safe in this clip. Following along too closely and taking a narrow inside lane like that will lead to accidents.
"Mate, I have bad news. You’re also one of the people this post is talking about."
"He was clearly drunk, i would knock the shit out of him"
"Driver in the clip has no business on that motorbike either, both are amateurs."
"lulz, what a muppet.

shame the big bike didn't hit the throttle, and exitebike wheelie over him."
Is that an MT03?
Didn't allow enough space to brake safely :)
"Your driving was not that good there either, honestly. You were driving way too fast for the whole time, the surrounding traffic considered, and not moving to the right side of the right lane as soon as getting the green light caused you ending up between him and the taxi. If you had ended up tailing the taxi *as you should have*, the whole situation would have been avoided entirely.

The guy was also visibly punched-out drunk out of his mind, which you *could* have observed, paid attention and avoided him if you were not trying to drive so fast. Yes, people DO often drive slower than what the speed limit permits and it frustrates me to no extent, but it does not mean that you shouldn't try to adapt to the surrounding traffic."
Urban area + 2 lanes = 60 I think 🤔 or I could be wrong Idk
"Thats true, a strong nation needs excellent traffic"
"Yup, they think skipping red light, going opposite direction is “alright” which is life hazard"
"Nature selection, not gonna lie"
Zipperheads
Thats is a really good answer. Thanks for your information
Most older people cut lanes. The young ones are more civil and use the sidewalks at least!
"I get the part that traffic cops ain't in anyway other than money incentivized to enforce the laws.

But fecal matter brained individuals endangering themselves without any common sense have only their stupidity to blame."
"Cant ride motorcycles at night no more since I realize its too dangerous since people kept turning on their high beam 😂. I use bike to go to work during rush hour because it faster, otherwise I drive car since I know I can’t die if I am driving 😂"
Source on the fatality stat?
I'm for the physical consequences.
"Thats true, in Hanoi some people don’t event wear helmets, in Saigon I almost never saw people without helmets"
"precisely. first time in hcm, i was shocked that people were obeying semaphores, not randomly going in 57 different directions, etc.

Yeah until ur family member died after getting crashed by people who skipped red light
"Yeah but in Vietnam it is a different level. Try to count the number of people skip red light, once I count 15 skipped while 3 stayed on the red light which pissed me off"

"And if a car and a motorcycle crash into each other, car driver is always wrong. Buy ur self a cam to clear the situation in case it occurs."
"The one thing that would help the most would be a mandatory *driving* test for motorbikes. Right now you are allowed to enter traffic with a motorbike without ever being tested how you operate on the road with actual vehicles around you. Going over bumps and circling around a donut is not a proof of proficiency in traffic.

In other words: you shouldn't be even allowed to enter traffic if you don't know the proper way to drive."
they also don't have jungle laws like VN. motorists will be held accountable in Taiwan.
"Vietnam was more civilized 50 years ago. South Vietnam, that was."

Very small progress right now. They are now building a subway here but will be done probably in a decade due to bureaucracy and red tapes.
"Yeah the fact I hadn't seen any accidents made me think that maybe there was more to it than luck. Watching this crash yesterday made me realise it really is just luck. It was a guy on one scooter crossing to another lane on a busy road without looking at his mirror. Another scooter coming along in that lane, seeing the guy crossing over just kept going rather than brake so they both just crashed into each other. Both riders seemed fine - I went over to check on them but there wasn't much I could do. One of them looked like he had a bit of a chunk of flesh taken out from his foot (flip flops might not be the best shoes if you're going to crash) but other than that I think it was just the scooter that took the damage."
"Bless you for being honest and also explaining the change once you had matured and realised the errors. 
I spent 7 years in your beautiful country as an English Teacher Saigon HCMC. I drove an FZ150 with no license, drove on the sidewalk and even paid my way out of traffic stops if pretending I didn't speak the language didn't work.

You should see how many people jaywalk in downtown Los Angeles
"Still even if u r right with a dash cam, police still gonna confiscate your car to “investigate” which will take months, i am talking 3-5 months. Normally the driver of the car will bribe the police and pay damage for the motorcycle even when motorcycle is wrong so their car will not be confiscated for half a year"
"Not always. In fact, car drivers often violently beat up motorbike drivers in Commie Vietnam when they got into traffic accidents, regardless of whose faults, because they somehow feel superior over the motorbike drivers based on delusion grandeur of perceived wealth in their heads (to be able to afford car). Same type of pompous attitude from Vietnamese Commie government officials' offspring when they harass citizens “Biết bố mày là ai không?”"
You weren’t even alive.
I know.
"bruv, i just watched a few of your vids. slow down in the city, that's far too aggressive riding. nobody pays attention in vn, this is a recipe for disaster.

i know it's tempting on a big bike, stuck in 1st or 2nd constantly. i have a ktm rc200, but usually putt around on the hayate in town. easier to park and less frustrating."
"Idk wtf that manoeuvre was, but it said enough about his skills."
That is true!
"To be honest, every Vietnamese had a bike accident. Guarantee. 
Planning to stay in Vietnam? Buy a car 😂"
"Well if u hit a jaywalker its the jaywalker fault. Here in Vietnam if you drive a car and a motorcycle hit you because of skipping red light, the driver of the car will automatically be responsible for the crash because of “lack of attention” rule which is stupid."
"Yeah, I know this because even the polices I know also admit this."
"Got it! Thanks for the advice there.  
I try to keep my eyes out for possible trouble on the road. I just like the acceleration, not speed so I only ride a naked bike. I try to stay away from slower clusters of people most of the time. :D"
"I just came from Thailand. Had several big bikes there. I actually would never consider a scooter. But here in Vietnam I just keep the scooter. There is no use for a big bike here. It would just run too hot all the time due to the low speeds you need to drive.

I thought Thailand was bad with their high ranking on deadly traffic accidents. But here people ride through red lights, take the wrong side of the road at cross roads, go onto main road without looking. Seems they think honking the horn solves all problems."
"I guess you never make mistake, but okay, I get it. Be aware!"
"yep. thai motorists are infinitely more civil and adhere much better to rules. once you're acclimated to vn's driving style, returning to thailand will infuriate everyone on the road. non-stop beeping and people yelling at you, kek.

big bikes in vn are generally a ballache. the larger concern is having them nicked or damaged. fairings guaranteed to be fucked up in no time. some turd in a £100 chinese ""honda"" win couldn't are less about knocking it over, or shoving his bike into an impossibly narrow space.

beaters are the way to go."
Well big bikes are getting a bit more respect with separate parking in Thailand. But my work place didn't and scooters still love the scratch up your bike.

"“I make money. I am rich. I buy a car. You are poor, you have a bike. Move out of the way you stupid poor idiot.”

That’s the mindset. In every setting the idea is to be selfish and then justify it through arrogance."
"I swear when I'm gonna cross somewhere the car is far and going at a normal speed, I have largely the time. Then I'm halfway and the car is 20m from me and accelerating while honking like a degenerate.

I mean I just wished the police would start to give fine on all the small infraction, speed ticket, crossing full line to turn the other way rather than just going arround the block, which would be faster. 

Anyway, won't be tomorrow."
"It’s the “might equals right culture” that is terrible. Also most people still learn to drive a bike first so they drive cars, trucks, and even busses like bikes. Look at the sleeper bus drivers and the sprinter bus drivers, absolute psycho drivers. 

Until people learn to drive cars first, like in many western countries, (which definitely aren’t great drivers either in their own way) the polite car drivers won’t exist. 

Fuck the car drivers too tho. They drive like entitled assholes (b/c they probably are). 

Vietnam is a bike country and should always be a bike country. They are way more efficient as well."

"The problem is driver training. Cars are a newish thing so they don’t have the skills and knowledge to deliver driver training at scale. 

Countries like Thailand have had cars for decades."
"These guys are barely off bicycles, and here they have cars. It's a catastrophe.  There isn't enough beer here for me to drive a car."
"Yeah, the sheer number of cars everywhere has gotten crazy. Around HCMC the highways are stressed from the current car traffic and around some of the main city roads. The metro is gonna be critical to taking people off the road.

I also hope that the government does not try to overextend the highways, this is the mistake that the US makes and it sucks. Vietnam Railways deserves more funding, and the metros must be built much quicker."
"> can we finally drop this charade and accept that Vietnam has possibly the worst driving culture on earth

wait I thought it's a truth universally acknowledged. Who is worse than us ?"
Folks with expensive cars in Vietnam feel they are superior. Everyone else are ants.
If you want good roads go to district 7 or da nang. Everything else is not planned and the govt just cares about  bribes. If they take responsibility for a project they'll have it used against them with the anticorruption campaign
"and they park their massive SUVs everywhere and anywhere

given that the average income in a place like Hanoi is 30k a year at best, it begs the question of how people are affording these vehicles

(hint, graft, credit and mortgaging mommy and daddy's house)"
"I couldnt agree more, its really bad here, one of the very few things i dislike about VN. As far as i can see theres 3 things that need to change, rigorous training, actual police enforcement ( rather than bribing them to go away), and lastly (and only semi seriously)…..road rage! In my home country if you were to drive as they do here it would only be a matter of time before someone follows you home and beats the shit out of you for endangering their life on the road, it certainly helps to keep you focused knowing that even if you get away with a terrible maneuver, if you evade the police, that you’ll still get battered when you get out of your car."
Jumping from riding a small motorbike to a massive suv. The roads are too small for the growing car traffic. Even the new highways are poorly designed and low quality. They are already full as soon as they open and after a few months are often full of potholes because the contractors cut corners and built as cheap as possible. Also nobody thinks to include emergency lanes for when there is an accident or including any petrol stations.
"Don’t worry, Manila is way worse. Literally drivers from hell."
"As more people switch from bikes to cars it will inevitably end up like Bangkok or Jakarta. Insane traffic jams, and tons of road fatalities"
"Vietnamese here. Vietnam had never had good traffic culture.
Driving in Vietnam is a literal battle, everyone is in combat mode, fighting tooth and nail for every bit of empty space on the road, and sidewalk. Someone is crossing the road? Better speed up and cut them off because going in front of them in 5cm shorter than going around. Stopping? What is that?"
"As a local working in one of a better income workplace, I'm the last person in my office without a car. Everyone else in my office, even  a single mom of two kids, are all having FOMO that if they don't get a driver license now, it will be much more difficult to get one and buy a car later because  they know there is less and less room in the city.
Also they always choose SUV or huge car even if used, that still cost 1.5x or 2x smaller new entry level car, because it's a status symbol and there is a belief that "" A grade car suck"" among new car owner. Also they tried reasoning that if they still have to pay the same parking spot then better go with a big car.

 That result in more and more and more stupid big car that take up a whole lane. Or worse parked illegally on a small road because they are too cheap to park in the parking lot, then two other car going from opposite directions refuse to give way for the remaining lane blocking the whole road during perk hours. Got late to work many time just because of this 2 opposite car and 1 parked car situation. They should absolutely ban road parking in city because 1) the city road isn't  build for this and 2)that would probably deter FOMO owners who believe that as long as they buy car they will figure out how to park it for free on the damn road. 

I'm still a firm believer of r/fuckcars because our company have employees bus, and very convenient public transit line close by. Bike is still more convenient in the city and if buying car just to serve rare times when you needed it, it's a big drain on the finances every month for a Vietnamese income and taxi is always available and cheaper. 

People believe car is great during rainy and sunny day, but fact is because everyone bring out their cars during those time, they will get stuck in traffic in double the time while being so stressed holding the wheel avoiding  hitting bike trying to pass them and preventing other car from surpassing them at the same time."
r/fuckcars
Big cities aren’t built for cars. Or you support government takes away people’s land for a re-development? Honestly Vietnam doesn’t need that many cars since most things that you need are in close proximity.
"""it's the man, not the vehicle"" - Maverick, Top Gun 2, 2022 something"
"I felt like it was worse in Hanoi than in Saigon. But yeah, definitely nerve wrecking specially crossing the street while pregnant."
I get sick of people in SUVs hooting all the time if I'm riding my bike in the left hand lane. They usually get the finger.
"People, here, do not have empathy and barely think in general. Cities are overcrowded and as you stated there a more cars... There are no laws or rules in general in this country, as long as you do not publicly criticize the communist party and its officials, you can do whatever yo want, in total impunity. It's only gonna get worse over time, as people are more and more giving up about caring and prefer scrolling on TikTok to infinity instead."
"""rethinking"" lmao Vietnamese drivers are morons. Just observe places like Orange County, San Jose, Houston, Austin, Florida ... Any Vietnamese community are interested with dumb ass drivers. You don't need to go back to the motherland to see this bullshit."
"Back when I lived in Vietnam, there was a countdown so people would know when the light turns green. Every time when there were about 15 seconds left, people would start moving already, and as a single abnormality, I would get multiple horns behind me and even trash talk. It's so hard to follow the rule and keep proper distance when your correct action will always result in your ancestors being called pig, dog or some more shitty words."
"Bike drivers and car drivers pointing fingers at each other when the real problem is a lack of mass transit systems.

Cars are terrible for the environment (natural and social) but, like many countries before then, Vietnam is chasing the short term economic boost that comes from getting them onto the streets. 

The solution to this problem was discovered centuries ago, but the problem is that mrt systems don't make the rich richer and therefore, unless the people demand it, will never happen. 

Look at pretty much every country in Latin America.

Tale as old as time."
"I predict that soon, Vietnam will be just like Thailand: big, fugly, concrete pedestrian bridges over the roads everywhere, to compensate for bad drivers. "
"I just want back to vietnam two weeks back and man the traffic over there is something else. Its like an organized chaos, its messy but somehow works"
Give it time. I remember China driving being (almost) as bad as here. It's has really improved since then.
It’s better not to own a car now especially in big cities worldwide
Look both ways before even stepping a foot onto the street
"One change to driving laws will make driving safer for everyone. Adopt ""at fault"" insurance rules where the actual guilty person has to pay for the accident, including and specially motorbikes. That will teach motorbikes, who cannot afford an accident with a car, to be more careful of their full surroundings not just whatever is in front of them.  On the other hand, cars will also be carefull with each other given that every other car on the road is also some luxury car. The insurance companies will not just take a 500k bribe to make the problem go away. They will raise your rates 500k a month and then people will feel it in their pockets and settle down."
"If you look at what’s happened in other SE Asian nations, and in China, when they tried to push cars instead of motorcycles you can see that once again Vietnam is just following that same bad path other places already when’re down.  Vietnam refuses to learn from the lessons and examples of other nations (I’ve had politicians here declare this to me as a point of misplaced pride), and as such is doomed to continually go about things like the transition to cars an a completely ass backward and foolish manner, with little to no planning for the future."
"What about safety of pedestrians ? How about human caring ? 

If you want change please start with pedestrian safety. 

Think safety culture and spreading awareness."
"The number of cars that try to drive past me when I NEED to stop for traffic (busses, cars, motorbikes, pedestrians)... Taxi drivers are often worse than personal cars, I find, so maybe the problem has always existed. But I agree that people drive cars the same way they do motorbikes and those skills DO NOT TRANSLATE. The roads will get more congested and less safe. It's like the only solution would be to take a train or metro and avoid most of traffic... (I live in HCMC)"
They drive badly they will fuck up sooner or later. I feel driving make you act much better on the road because the cost of wrong doing is high and the limited wiggling you can do with your car.
"They have no motor vehicle operating culture or standards. You can put a Việt 
Behind the Wheel but his brain is still on a motorbike. I used to travel a route that had outlines 1-2 times per week. I’ve seen large trucks pull blindly into traffic on dozens of occasions; they’re reckless af. I’m looking for things to get progressively worse. Vietnamese will not give up motorbikes. There needs to be strict standards for traffic management in congested areas. Part of the problem is that the police are a money racket and in no way a service organization. They’re only interested in easy money to make their masters happy. Vehicles are quicker and a larger part of the traffic is becoming high powered motorcycles."
"I'm Vietnamese, and I left the country to go work in Japan for 3 years. And when I came back, holy crap do I hate the driving culture here. Made me miss how Japanese traffic flowed and how people respected each other on the road. I did notice there were more cars when I came back. But the driving behavior did not change at all. People treat the road like it's a competition, that's the problem here."
"God bless you if you accidentally get in front of the bus. Those fuckers will happily hit you, paralyze you from the waist down rather than stopping for 30 seconds"
having been to both Vietnam and Houston I'd say you're like 10 years behind but could definitely catch up in less time
"I left Ha Noi right around the time when big cars were starting to become more prevelant, so I'm not sure how it is now, but when I left there was a very clear  ""I'm a big important person in a big important car so if you get run over by me it's because you're a lowly motorbike driver and should have behaved accordingly."" vibe. Like big SUVs pulling out of little alleyways without looking in any direction at all.

I live in TH now and the same thing happens, only cars have been common here for longer and car drivers are very sure of their status as kings of the road who do not need to look out for motorbike drivers."
"Rather, I think they should just rethink the sale of cars, which wouldn't be ideal, but glancing around, it seems urban areas literally can't handle many more people owning one, especially these stupid needlessly large SUVs. Small cars pretty much don't exist. Rethinking traffic culture won't matter in absolute gridlock which is what will happen if a larger % of people ditch their scooters for a car."
"Don’t drive in Vietnam. Trust me, it’s not worth it"
 The short answer is - Noone 😎
"The 'system' has fallen apart, hasn't it? The entitlement of the average car owner makes getting around really difficult now."
"On my first trip there in the 90s, II rode my bike from HCM to Hue, then took the Reunification Express to Hanoi. At that time, half the locals were riding bicycles like me and the other half motorbikes. You had to watch out for the buses and trucks though. Went back in 2017 and there’s no way I’d bride a bike there again, except maybe on very rural roads. Hardly any bicycles left, a million cars and a zillion motorbikes. Never had a problem with walking though. Cross with the pack, don’t zig, don’t speed up, don’t slow down, and don’t stop til you reach the other side. For handicapped individuals or people like the woman you mentioned, it’s a whole lot harder. Vietnam is the most infamous nation like this, but there are others just as bad. "
If you think Saigon is bad wait till you see Jakarta
"It did flow, but cars have ruined that like they ruined children playing in the street in the UK."
Hello from Thailand. It’s worse here.
"It's like an ocean. 

Motorbikes are the swarm of fish that travel together. 

Cars are like small sharks, that you can buddy up with. 

Anything bigger is a whale. 

And all the honking is echolocation."
"You need to travel more if you think Vietnam is the worst on earth. And it does flow, pretty much the same as everywhere in Asia."
"How about we ask the uncles, aunties and folk that actually use the roads daily and how they feel about it.  I bet They don’t give a shit, as long as it’s flowing and they get to where they need to be. Safety is a bit shit but you’re only going 40kmph. 

As for the preggo lady I couldn’t imagine her giving any shits either. The only one that would be upset is the driver. 

Don’t bring self entitlement to the roads of VN. It works fine. The road conditions could be certainly be improved. 

Look at western roads and their dash cam footage. Increase in road rage and ludicrously dangerous retaliating behaviour. I don’t want that here. 
Let it be!"
"Ba sọc à? :))))

Ko thích thì cút sang Cali mà lái bạn ơi... chúng nó nói thế :))))"
"Driving on the highways here I am constantly amazed at how you can signal to show you need to change lane to make an upcoming exit and the person next to you will just refuse to let you do it. 

It’s absolutely maddening. "
"This is the one thing that absolutely blows my mind when I came here from America.   
  
People blocking intersections. That in itself is causing so many problems. I would love, just once, a bunch of police start pulling people over who block intersections with their cars or massive trucks."
You just described driving culture in Manila and Jakarta.
"I can confirm that car drivers cause the biggest problems while I was in VN a month ago. Bad insertions, random brake checks, overtaking on the right, and the list goes on... Plus, the entitlement and recklessness of the drivers make it a hundred times worse.

Not to say that motorcycles do not cause any problems, but their mistakes usually have smaller consequences and riders are much more used to navigating a busy street on their motorcycle than drivers in VN, since cars are a novelty to the wider population."
"People waiting in the right lane at lights drive me mad, as do cars and trucks jamming up the motorcycle lane on busy roads"
It’s hardly any better in Danang to be honest. Bigger streets (mostly east side of the city) mean that drivers can drive faster and give even less space or reaction time to anyone else. Also a massive villager mindset dominates the driving culture where every driver is very bullish and downright aggressive.
It's still mayhem wherever you'll be honestly
"Da Nang is stupider and more reckless. Sorry, won’t work. Also, Da Nang cops love to fine foreigners"
💯
Motorcycle ls are just as bad has nothing to do with money
"A very noticeable driving culture thing here is that in other countries when crossing the street oncoming cars will ease off the gas, even if you have plenty of time to cross already, as a courtesy to show you that you can cross safely. 

Here people do the complete opposite and stamp on the accelerator to close the gap and either prevent you from crossing or force you to run. "
It's a recurring problem in SK as well. Driving a car makes people feel entitled to their share of the road. Or maybe it's the opposite and their entitlement comes from their socio-economic situation which afforded them a car in the first place.
"people learn to ride bicycles first in the west

there just isn't a 'me me me' culture of entitlement"

"Just moved to Thailand (BKK) this year after 10 years in Vietnam (HCMC) - the Thai driving culture is a million times more organized and respectful than in Vietnam. My partner an I are probably the only people in the city that feel amazed every time a car stops at a crosswalk to let someone past, and no honking. It’s incredible."
Thailand has terrible driving too.
"I really can’t agree with this take. Training has no connection to mindset and culture. You can train a person to operate an F1 car but if they drive with a mindset that the world belongs to them you will have a terrible driver. 

A grab driver recently told me that driving in Vietnam makes him depressed because it causes him to hate his fellow countrymen. "
"Training won't change anything, cause they don't care and will never care about anyone but themselves."
">I also hope that the government does not try to overextend the highways, this is the mistake that the US makes and it sucks. Vietnam Railways deserves more funding, and the metros must be built much quicker.

Same in New Zealand - we're getting more public transport now, but it's still not that great. VN has the potential to make awesome public transport everywhere"
"We would hugely benefit from actual functioning urban metro in big cities, imagine a real North-South high speed rail. Mass transit is the right direction to take, I believe the gov’ is really trying to make it happen. But when you bring up that argument with car people, they would just mock you and think that you’re poor and can’t afford a car. Sorry but I don’t wanna drive a car in streets barely wide enough to fit 2 cars, with sweaty shitty middle aged men actively trying to run everyone over to satisfy their inflated egos."
"Any time this topic comes up you find sensitive locals who can’t process criticism telling foreigners that they must adapt to the Vietnamese ‘system’, or alternatively you get insufferable foreigners claiming that there is some kind of invisible spiritual ‘flow’ to the traffic here that they have successfully figured out. 

Then you tell them that 15,000 people die every year and they downvote you and get mad. "
India from what I hear. 
That's not exclusive to Vietnam to be fair...
"Cities built to accommodate lots of car traffic are guaranteed to be boring and awful. 

See boring/dead/impoverished downtowns of any US city (except New York, which has good transit) for examples. 

See pleasant/lively European cities where car traffic is limited for the opposite example."
Yeah people drive cars as if they are still on a motorbike. Stop in the middle of the road to buy a coffee from a street vendor. Who cares if I block a whole lane and cause a massive traffic jam as long as I don't have to leave my vehicle to get my coffee.
30k USD a year you mean?!!
"no one here has said it yet, so I will give the actual reason : high saving. Vietnam saving to gdp are on par with China/Singapore hovering around 40% of gdp (which is very high compared to most countries averaging at 20-25%) so everyone just save all their lives instead of borrowing, Vietnam has really low debt to gdp, it has been hovering at around 30% even during 2020 when Covid hit (which is insasely low compared to most country averaging at 60-90%). Now that saving are high enough and low cost car start to hit the market in great quatity, second-hand luxury or small car/kei car, people start to buy car at an extremely fast rate all in a small window of time. So that's all there is to it. I doubt most of those car are paid by debt, if they can't afford it, I don't think they would even consider buying just due to how being in debt is perceived as a bad phenomena to a lot of Vietnamese, at least to those that I know of."
"People do respond to social policing, but practically nobody does it.

Whenever I've told people to turn their high beams off or looked people in the eye and said ""no"" when they try to push in, they do it. 

More people need to grow a spine and social police, then you create a society."
"Ummm not exactly true, only if you live and stay in the central city districts which many do but the majority don’t - we live suburban or outside where there isn’t much public transportation so for mid and longer journeys/commuting you can use a scooter (dangerous, get wet in rainy season, open to the elements, pollution especially in rush hour) or you can use a clean, safer, air conditioned car, x10 if you have kids."
Or worse when they take over the right hand lane which is supposed to be for motorbikes and still hoot
"Currently here, it just work for some reason, everyone just smoothly routes to their destination. I bet those motorists arms are like thanos. Honking and braking"
I think the whole point of the thread was to highlight that it absolutely doesn’t work. As they transition from bikes to cars everything is rapidly getting worse from an already dire starting point. 
They have rigorous enforcement haha

A strong metro network would fix a lot of it, but considering how that's going I think I'd be long dead before that happens. It would be better off with tuk-tuks, as at least they can navigate the narrow alleys and traffic, but vn don't want to be like their 'poor neighbors' and need to show off having big cars..."
I think Saigon is honestly worse because it has better road infrastructure than places like Jakarta. Saigon’s streets are really no different from most American or European cities - the infrastructure is there. It’s the mentality of the people doing the driving. 
This was one of those cities where that banned motorbikes and the traffic instantly (and not surprisingly) got much worse
Also thought Jakarta was worse
"No way. I’ve been living in Hanoi for over 6 years now and I was genuinely surprised at how much better people drive in Thailand, to the point where I was shocked how people were driving in the correct lanes and didn’t honk every 3 seconds. Genuinely surprised me. I was deadset impressed"
Nope it definitely does not. Have you driven in Thailand or Malaysia? Singapore Japan Taiwan?
"Flows so well that the government is completely giving up on roundabouts and removing all of them? 

Get a grip. "
“Don’t bring entitlement to the roads of Vietnam” is possibly the funniest comment I have read in 2024. 
This comment screams 'I've never learned how to drive'
"Lol, I see you got the downvotes that I thought were destined for me. You get it. I got you back up to -9 :)"
"“If you don’t like it go home” 

Don’t worry, there’s a reason Vietnam tops global charts for visitors who come once and never come back. They all follow your advice 👍"
Guess what the horn is for?
"The worst thing is that it is so obviously the dumbest thing anyone can do. Such drivers might as well drape a banner over their bonnet saying ""look how stupid and selfish I am."""
"LOL, Police, 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣"
"I have spent some time in the Philippines, also in Manila, and it didn’t feel anything like Saigon. From what I heard, there aren’t many places (outside of India) where traffic is comparable to HCMC."
"Da Nang have infrastructures in place to handle car culture and public transportation. That's all I need.
People drive faster? GREAT!
When you learned how to handle yourself in Hanoi trafic, everywhere else is an quality of life improvement."
Yes and it's not justified but a motorcycle is a lot less likely to kill someone than a car or SUV
"In four days in Bangkok last month, drivers stopped to let me cross the road more times than has ever happened in my five years living here."
"I’ve been driving for 20+ years, I’m from a Western European county that has some of the highest driver training standards in the world. 

After driving in Vietnam, watching others drive and being in cars with them driving. They don’t know how to drive, the skills to teach people effectively don’t exist in the country which is the main problem"
"They drive cars like a bike, close together, speed, take any possible open space, beep when people are near you…etc. was my point. It’s a different mindset when learning to drive and you can’t really unlearn it."
"The reason that traffic deaths are so low in Singapore is that most people don't need to drive at all. The transit goes almost everywhere, so you just ride the trains instead. Being on the road is better than Vietnam, for sure, but there's definitely no ""defensive driving."""

"Having driven in Thailand, their traffic at least knows what lanes are and even when I travelled in busy periods, it didn't feel anywhere as near as chaotic as what would have been the equivalent in VN."
"Having lived in Vietnam and visited Thailand, I can say i was amazed at Thailand’s generally good driving. As a point of comparison."
Compared to Vietnam? No chance the drivers are generally competent and rarely if ever use the horn.
"It does, but it is still better than in Vietnam. "
I thought they're driving was quite good actually. Helps that they have a longer history of driving while Vietnam doesn't.
"Yeah, taxis and Uber drivers are frequently psycho morons - they drive super fast in open areas trying to make up time. So stupid that they don’t realize that they are racing to the next traffic clog."
"Well, I was trained to stop when a pedestrian look like he would like to cross, to not enter intersection if it is blocked… Violating things like that in the exam costs points or even leads to elimination immediately. Violating those after you got your license costs points too. Clearly those things can be forced into the drivers."
"That is a very stupid statement. If you train someone you train him to operate the vehicle the right way. Training includes mindset, rules and responsibility.


If you trianed someone in driving and he drives like a maniac, you trained him very wrong. "
You just need rigorous enforcement and
"Yep. As a foreigner who's been living here for most of the transition to cars, it's difficult to watch. There is definitely a jump in status when owning a car, and with that comes the problems of entitlement. There are like many countries things that need to change on roads, but in Vietnam, it will not begin to change until having a car is not seen as status symbols in a status focussed society. Regulations are useless as regular enforcement is not really part of the culture. Most things that are abided by here are governed by social acceptance, not policing. 

Personally,  I can't see a way through. If any regulations are created or enforced, they will only be to serve cars as those are the people with influence. Which, in turn, will make it worse, and more rules will follow to suit cars. Vietnam needs a massive effort by the government to push and implement public transport similar to Japan, and I can't see that happening within the next century."
Bro it takes 13 years to build a train line in this country go plan it yourself then and give it to them
"USA is a bad example because the national interstate highway act was horribly implemented and didnt account for future advances

Take a look at Canada instead. Vancouver has relatively horrible transit compared to NYC, but the city is alive, bustling and beautiful. Victoria BC, with the same population density as Toronto, even more beautiful, extremely alive and well - horrible public transit. 

You can have a city accommodate lots of traffic without having sprawling bridge intersections 5 football fields wide. The USA is just horrible at it"
Compare Phoenix to Boston and you will know why I moved to the land where roads are chaotic because people drive much slower and traffic accidents are much more manageable.
yes

"First, I don’t often hear people commute daily from suburban to central cities for work in Vietnam.

Second, it is cheaper and accessible if you just contact a travel agency for a van/bus for some occasions.

Third, the infrastructure to support cars is huge. You not only need a bigger road but many parking lots to make it truly for cars.

Final point is USA also does have traffic and road rage. It is not uncommon these days. People even get shot at."
Fr its quite fascinating
"Everyone smoothly gets to their destination except for the 15,000 people who die every year? "
"Well the government here is trying to be like that too, so just give it time lol. We'll all have better traffic and have to biometrically sign off on every transaction soon enough 🙂"
"Saigon has massively improved over the last 5 years. The problem is that there’s no place to go when they get there. No place has a parking lot. There are parking garages a few exclusive places but that may as well be zero. I was living in An Phu, my complex had about 50% too few parking spaces."
The honking is a cultural thing. You don’t honk here unless you’re ready to fight someone with a gun.

Nothing? The same f-wits dgaf.

They'll set up speeding traps for people or getting those going down the wrong way on a road, but they won't go after the easy fish of people blocking the intersection."

Depends on where. Driving in the north felt much worse than in BKK.
You been there during Tet? It’s generally not much better.
Different degrees of unsafe.
Their driving test is a joke. Having a long history doesn’t mean much by itself.
"Well, the other guy is also right. You can train the person for 1 year and they follow the rules in the exam and maybe after that for another year. If they drive like a maniac in the exam, lol, surely they won’t pass.

But if they live in a chaotic environment where few follow rules, well, unless they have good self-esteem and discipline, they will eventually turn into maniac drivers."
"I don’t think it’s stupid at all. You can train a person that if the obstruction in the road is on your side, you should yield to the oncoming car and then proceed. 

If the person doesn’t believe they should ever yield to anyone for any reason ever, they will completely disregard your training and drive like a dickhead. 

You act like every driver here isn’t required to sit a paper exam where they explicitly tick boxes to say they understand when and where to yield. Then they get out on the road and don’t give an inch of space to anyone. "
"Agree with this. China has made progress through enforcement. There is a noticeable change in a lot of anti social behavior, not just driving, thanks to firm effort to enforce rules. "
Doesn't China also ban low-cost vehicles like scooters and cyclos from tier-one cities?
"The perfect visual metaphor for what you are describing can be found directly opposite the main police station in Thao Dien where every day you can see the sidewalk entirely obstructed by two brand new shiny cars owned by the two top officials working at the police station. 

Pedestrians have to walk into oncoming traffic to get around them. And they do it every day. "
"😳 Dear god, that's not even close at all"
lol weird conclusion.
"1. Most people who work in d1 live outside the central districts (1/3/4). 

2. What? Where’s the convenience in that?

3. Vietnam is getting better infrastructure, even the centre vs 20 years ago. Needed too because transportation costs decrease and in helps gdp. Highways, Tunnels, bridges, bypasses … but more needed. As well as high speed train and connections. And of course more pedestrian and green areas too. 

4. Irrelevant."
"Statistics looking yes, but looking at it while you’re on Grab, motorbike, or a bus. It looks different. I’m not trying to challenge your opinion."

"Thanks, that's a cool site!"
You think the standards of traffic in Thailand and Vietnam are comparable? In Vietnam all I see is poor driving causing traffic

"Young people don’t spit on the floor indoors or dispose of their garbage by setting it on fire in the hallway but that’s about the extent of this supposedly new and civil generation. 

The local high school lets out for lunch every day and a mob of teens cannot form a simple line at the family mart. They shove and push to get to the front just like their parents to. It doesn’t matter if I’m already at the register, they will reach past me and put their items down and start waving cash to cut in line. 

They still talk constantly during movies at the theatre. They still take every phone call on speaker. They hang out at the river on Friday nights and leave all their garbage behind. They still drive with a psychotic lack of basic consideration of other human beings. 

I think this optimism in the future generation is very rose tinted. "
"There is influx of new drivers getting their car but with shitty instructor. So maybe the annoying one you met is just a newbie who doesn't know what's what.

Just do whatever necessary, solve the problem first,"
VN police are a theft racket.
"Haha not so much that it amazes me, just a marked increase from Vietnam. But I do aim to go to Uzbekistan next year!"
"I think speeds drop is another problem, due to low traffic speeds in Vietnam in general highways have ridiculously low speed limits. I saw hai phong to ha long with a speed limit of 80km/h 😂"
"That is encouraging to hear. I wish it didn’t take nanny state shit like speed cams and police everywhere, but maybe that’s what it takes to break the habit. 

The whole drive a car like a bike isn’t unique to Vietnam tho. It’s everywhere in the developing world. Check out the drivers in India it’s much worse."

"comparing a massive holiday's driving skills against the average days driving skills isnt really valid, I'm sure you know this."
I know nothing of the Thai driving test but I can guarantee you it's better than the Vietnamese one. I said it has a longER history of driving which does mean something.
Maybe a joke but it isn’t reflected in the driving standards
"You don't know what training is.


What you mean is ""you can TELL a person xy but if he doesn't listen"" 


Training is way more than just telling someone something. Proper training would make a difference. "
"They ban petrol powered ones yes, to combat pollution  and noise and it works. Watching traffic in big Chinese cities is like watching tv on mute, there’s very little noise as it’s all mostly electric"
"damn, you're right. it's closer to 7k USD per year (median, not average)

How are people affording all those SUVs?

Is it really just stupid people taking on massive loans that they'll never be able to pay off in order to impress other stupid people?

Do you have a different explanation?

And when the financial system inevitably collapses because millions of people can't pay back loans they should have never been given, but we're encouraged to take in order to generate more tax revenue, who do you think will get blamed?"
"Yeah anything for the rich. Why majority of population have to change for the ones who can afford cars? 

You are mixing up cars and public transport. More public transport coupled with excellent city planning will do wonders. More PERSONAL cars aren’t good things. 

Have you heard the term induced traffic/induced demand?

Why 4 is irrelevant? It is not part of culture? Better infrastructure doesn’t necessarily mean better culture?"
[deleted]
"Yeah I’m hard disagree with the top comment too. Face-saving cope. I’ve lived in or visited 4 other Asian countries, nowhere could even compare with the chaos, lawlessness and danger of Vietnam roads."
I think the way they flow is. Everything else is down to the sheer volume. I was driving in Nha Trang last year and it was way easier than Bangkok. But HCM is way worse than Koh Samui. That’s just the number of vehicles.
"Cars cause traffic.

Poor driving doesn’t help but it is negligible. 

I.e. traffic is much worse in Houston than it is in HCMC even tho people generally follow the rules in Houston. 

The difference is that everyone drives a car in Houston. More cars = worse traffic. No amount of driver education will change that formula."
Ignorance is bliss. Sucks to be you
"There’s so many over using the horn that nobody pays attention. Further, there’s people that think they can get turbo like a video game by honking constantly."
"Cool! It's a unique and worthwhile destination for sure!

As for the traffic: If there is a zebra at a spot where there is no stoplight, you can cross, period. Provided you don't give the driver in the right-most lane some ridiculously small window of time to react, the first car will come to a stop precisely at the zebra, and the rest will follow suit in a cascade. You feel like a foreign dignitary who's come for a state visit, all the more so because 95% of the cars in UZ are white Chevys. 

(This is really noticeable in Tashkent because the streets are ridiculously wide there, but if you're not especially interested in practicing Russian or in Soviet history then you probably won't stay long in the capital.)"
"Question, how are rear-end collisions handled? Also, does the insurance pay?"
Just an example. Source I lived there for 5 years.
Driving skills are driving skills. They don't change based on the calendar
It’s a joke because you don’t need to take it to pass it. You just need to pay money.
Yes it is.
"Training is teaching a person a skill or a behavior. You can train a person when and where to properly yield. 

They can then completely ignore your training because local culture does not yield to anyone. 

Again, people here sit a written exam in which they must prove that they understand a deep swathe of traffic behaviors. They then disregard all of them. "
"For people wearing Green uniforms it's obviously corruption, otherwise as there has been and still is a big real estate bubble (not big but massive), IMO they use their land and properties as collateral or things like this. The market in VN is rotten to the core. I wouldn't leave my money in those banks."
"I’d say they mostly get the money through real estate sales. Just until very recently most people in Vietnam owns land, and since the market is incredibly inflated right now, people can just sell their piece(s) of land at their hometown to buy a car and a house in the city."
"Rich people are very rich. Hardly anyone has an SUV as a % of the population, but they sure take up a lot of the road. I doubt it's poor people taking loans to buy one; the tax is sky high on them and I can't see many banks lending someone on $7k a year enough to buy one"
"Your opinion is noted as exactly that. 

Cars come to middle class already, where you been? 

Vietnam wants to be an industrial “first world” nation. It’s 40 years behind more developed countries like Thailand and Malaysia. Yet there is no real investment in shared public transportation infrastructure at the moment, and when, on the rare occasions there is it usually fails due to corruption. Hanoi is doing ok with the metro which is great. It doesn’t even have the highway infrastructure yet. First things first."
"Yeah your summary is pretty correct there. Data is trash and studies support that claim.

Over-reliance of verbal autopsies (i.e asking their relatives why the think the person died) and then that's recorded in the system as the official COD (cause of death). This means the system has 'complete data' but the data itself is unreliable.

"Holidays can bring in tons of people from various regions into a centralized area, creating chaos that most may not be used to, in turn causing more chaos. People have plans, they have family deadlines, family counting on them to be somewhere at X time or pick someone up in time for festivities, reservations, flights to catch etc. Holidays involve celebrations, which can be drinking or recreational drug use or whatever, lack of sleep etc. 

Globally you can see a higher percentage of accidents around peak holiday times. This is well known."
"Even if you pay money, culture and influence is a big thing. If your grandad knows how to drive he taught your dad to drive who taught you to drive etc etc. a lot of skillls and knowledge passed through generations that doesn’t exist in Vietnam

Oh it’s the same with mechanics"
"Again, that's just telling someone something and is considered very poor training.


And if someone disregards everything, he hasn't learned anything. "

"“U don’t get it maaaan!” Very compelling argument, but random opinions from strangers claiming their experience is more valid than mine don’t carry much weight. Another commenter even posted peer reviewed studies documenting how Vietnam doesn’t conform to international standards in reporting causes of death. 

Motorbike drivers learning not to have road rage is not mutually exclusive with it being a dangerous place in traffic. In my experience drivers of larger vehicles often feel exempt from the need to control their emotions and drive in a give and take manner, which leads to the fatalities I mentioned. 

But I mean sure, go on saying your anecdotal evidence counts and mine doesn’t, by all means."
This is the way!! Well said mate.
"lol, am I missing something? That’s my entire point."
"Yeah, I was wandering about that. So it’s a cultural complete lack of knowledge and conscientiousness. I always thought that driving in VN was dismal but that just ices it."
"That’s not how it works in practice. Vietnam and Thailand have nearly the same amount of traffic fatalities per 100,000 population."
"It’s literally the dictionary definition of training. Try googling define: training and the exact sentence I produced is what you will see. 

My partner was trained in driving in Western Europe in one of the strictest countries on earth for driving regulations. It takes a year on average to get a license. 

When she’s back in Vietnam I have to constantly tell her to stop driving like an idiot and her constant response is that’s just the way things are here.

It’s hugely patronizing for foreigners to come to places like Vietnam and insist that if only our superior western training were to properly educate people all of these problems would go away. 

As my grab driver himself said, ‘nobody here will ever give you space. Not one centimeter. If you give up space you are losing to the other driver. Every other vehicle on the road is your enemy. It’s depressing.’

I couldn’t agree with him more. "
"It is, very rude and arrogant to dismiss someone’s experiences based on years just because one has more years. Multiple full years in different countries is enough for me to feel comfortable my perceptions aren’t just tourist first impressions. 

Like, I get what the commenter is saying. It doesn’t take decades to notice how motorbike riders often maintain calm and have some interesting skills due to necessity. But that won’t change the fatalities caused by aggressive drivers in large vehicles i saw firsthand- hit and runs with no consequences too. Cheap words on reddit can’t erase memories like that."
Maybe but Vietnam road speeds are lower and I’m suspecting per km driven is lower
"Sorry to double post but the logic of “if you disregard something you must not have learned” is just objectively stupid. 

If you disregard the law and murder someone, you must not have learned that you aren’t supposed to murder. 

Give me a break. "
In which country does it take a year to get a licence? You are just making things up. 
Thailand has the 16th highest number of traffic fatalities per 100.000 in the world. It’s not an example of car safety.
A lot lower on both accounts. Việt drivers generally suck but they are chill. Thai is imho a mixed bag. The better TH drivers are way better than what you have in VN But the psycho TH drivers are way crazier and more frequent than VN.
"That's how I had to do it in Switzerland: 
First you have to do a first aid course
Then theoretical exam
Then start driving lessons
Then take another course to get deeper knowledge about traffic
Then pass the driving exam
Then take a course about safety, which took a whole weekend
Then take a course about how to safe petrol for another weekend. 
If you don't do those last two things within five years after your driving exam, you will lose your license."
"You can easily just google these things yourself, or have you not been properly trained yet?

https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-average-time-of-getting-a-license-for-driving-in-Europe"
Of course not but we are comparing to Vietnam here.
"Don’t think I’ve seen many psychos In Thailand, just people that drive fast. 
They are extremely chill in Thailand too. I rarely hear the horn."
Vietnam is 20 so it’s actually marginally better. Not enough to use one as an example of a generational difference.
"I’ve only visited Thailand and I guess I got lucky with the psycho drivers. I swear one guy was like too fast too furious, I was getting tossed around the seat and banged my head. Another nut job nearly rear ended stopped traffic"
But what about stats per km driven and road speeds? You aren’t painting the full picture.
Deffo.
I don’t have those figures. Not sure if anyone does but if you have them I am interested to see.
"I dunno if everyone else feels the same. I tend to find driving in the countryside a bit more dangerous/have seen more injuries. Saigon seems to work like a beehive, organised chaos, but it's organised and everybody knows where and when to go.

The only thing that scares me in Saigon is the people who insist on driving those gigantic pickup truck things."
"Having toured every province in Thailand and rode from Hanoi to Saigon... some observations:

Drivers in Thailand tend to drive way faster. The giant school of motorbikes in a Vietnamese city may look very intimidating but due to the slower speeds and the general go with the flow nature of it, it's actually quite easy to ride around the cities of Vietnam. Now out on the highways... man Vietnam feels way more dangerous, a truck will literally run you off the road if it means they can pass someone else. 

In Thailand they generally work together and yield whereas in Vietnam it often feels like a constant game of chicken, but again, there is a flow to it. I think it's also why there is a lot less honking in Thailand.

The reason Thailand has such a high mortality rate revolves around all the drunk driving during Songkran. Maybe I've just been lucky but after all that riding in both countries... I've never seen an accident in either one."
"Man, as a Vietnamese, it is... morbidly interesting for me to learn about this. I mean, traffic and traffic accidents in Viet Nam is terrible. And as it turns out, it is still not the worst in the region?

Htf?"
Good job on enforcing zero alcohol I suppose. So many families have been saved from unnecessary heartaches.
I guess the heavy fine on drinking was working. I see people refuse to drink or book a grab after drinking is much more usuall now.
2020 kind of a weird year to measure this
i fear for my life 5% of the time i sit behind a motorbike in vietnam. i fear for my life every single fucking time i sit behind a motorbike in thailand
"Can't have any traffic accidents if everybody is driving in a traffic jam 😭😭😭.

Jokes aside I am glad the alcohol consumption is reduced more and more every year."
"As someone who saw a street cleaner, who could be somebody's father or husband, get killed by a drunker, I'm quite happy that the zero-alcohol laws are making a good impact.

P/S Damn me, this is from 2020. But in the recent news, traffic casualty has decreased significantly. So that's good too."
Do you have per-capita numbers?
"I can guarantee you the casualty rate in Thailand is so high because people there are driving SUVs and Pickup trucks like they would a 50cc scooter. 

In Vietnam I know nobody will stop and crossing the road people will swerve around you. But Thailand ? Will they stop? Will they continue to drive ? It's impossible to predict and I've had a few close calls in Bangkok"
sinkies can't drive
It's a very good result! Vietnamese should be extremely happy about this.
"Low speeds, Vietnam highway speed limits are 80,"
That is obvious as the Thai people drive like maniacs.
"For me it seems like in the big cities at least, no one is really going fast enough to cause fatal injuries."
"""SLOW"" - this is the key to survive"
"Wtf is thailand doing, playing bumper carts?"
"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

those numbers are 100% unadulterated bullshit.

real stats here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_countries\_by\_traffic-related\_death\_rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_traffic-related_death_rate)

sg is one of the safest countries in the world, whilst vn is one of the most fatal."
"Well, strong warriors were born different, hard times make tough guys. The traffic in Vietnam is so chaos that the drivers here improved their skills day by day. Facing the constant challenge of navigating through unpredictable traffic, they honed their reflexes, adaptability, and patience, becoming some of the most skilled drivers in the world.🐧"
"This is just absolute number.  It ignores population size, number of vehicles and miles driven."
"There is ample research that shows the reason for this - namely that as countries develop and build bigger roads, speeds pick up and fatalities rise (before reaching the development level where safety is better incorporated such as in the west). "
„Reported“
Thailand has the worst drivers
I don’t believe it. I lived in Thailand for 5 years. I saw more accidents in my first year in Vietnam than my entire time in Thailand.
The Vietnamese hands are extremely meticulous. They can control their bike by centimeters.
"keep in mind that the statistics rely on what is reported, it's not necessarily what actually happened"
"Okay, I think I've worked it out. 

It is for 2020.

Vietnam had much stricter lockdowns than the other countries. 

COVID saved thousands of people from getting hurt on the road."
"Less than 10% is reported, otherwise the local police do not meet their KPIs"
The Vietnamese hands are extremely meticulous. They can control their bike by centimeters. It may look chaotic but everyone knows exactly what's going on and control it.
Maybe bcuz people are too experienced in solving situations that could lead to accidents
"This just a count, not a rate. Weird way to present this."
"Did all the traffic accident casualties were reported? That is a question one can ask when looking at this. Lack of data can give an incorrect representation of what actually is happening.

For example, even with a population like Philippines but with only less than 1000 of traffic accidents casualties in the whole of 2020 year while Singapore with a population around 5 mil got almost 7000 cases, does that make sense?"
"low rank in the graph looks good on the surface but there is something more than that apparently when Cambodia and the Philippines rank lower than Vietnam, while Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore all rank higher in the graph. It should be the other way around normally. There must be other factors that need to be considered, like vehicles per capita or something."
"not many people fail to realized that the data is from 2020, practically not many people driving outside at that time. Vietnam start social distance in 1/4/20 due to COVID"
"In 2020 we have covid lock down, which affects the result I think"
*declared
"I think we can safely call BS on this one. What’s the source??? 
It also covers Injuries (not fatalities) and I don’t think I have ever seen police turn up for non fatal accidents."
"lower speed traffic, less cars, cars dont go more than 40k’s ph in the city. Saw a dead guy the other night though in saigon that came off his hotted up bike, was pretty intense

the highways between cities are hell though"
"Those numbers are really hard to believe, Laos (7.5 Mio people) has 3 times more accident casualties/injuries compared to Vietnam (100 Mio people)?"
"It's not like we are good at obeying the law or anything. Vehicles move at a relatively slow speed, and the traffic is a mess that requires extra attention."
get good at riding
of course...

"This must be based on reported numbers because there is no way Singapore has more casualties than Vietnam when Singaporeans are the most sane drivers in Southeast Asia.

I do think road quality is a contributing factor. Thailand has really bad roads, so it's not just the driving skills that are to blame."
"Is a lie 
and people don’t know how to report accidents.
Yesterday on the way to the store i saw two accidents in the span of 20 minutes.
The traffic police is only interested when is bribes involved or some one do actually die.
People drive like idiots. Cars turning right do it from the left lane. Motorcycles turning left do from the right lane.
Speed limits? Is a joke. Roads suck. Traffic lights have timers and when is 3-5 seconds left is the cavalry charging.
Hundreds of scooters just drive simultaneously. If you happen to have a car good luck in traffic.
Vietnam only has one highway is is not even
Finished as of February 2024.
The country’s automobile history is only 10-15 years old."
What the heck is going on in Thailand
Từ nơi đồng xanh thơm hương lúa but unironically
"I’m surprised Cambodia isn’t further up, I saw 4 crashes and one person who did not look like he survived in the space of two weeks."
The places with the most dangerous traffic flow are the highways (quốc lộ). Too many heavyweight vehicles driving right next to scooters so accidents are easily expected. Also the highways are mostly covered with countries side and smaller cities where people are a lot more reckless when riding scooters (lots of kids and young guys with high need4speed)
Been to saigon and was too scared to cross the road until an old lady led me the way lol
"Dense traffic make most people drive slowly, so less crashes"
and educational level tends to play a role as well. Idk why but family in the countryside let kids 14-15 or even younger driving motorbike and worse without helmets. They are more prone to drunk driving as well
"Even if you want to go fast in Sai Gon, you can’t. Most of traffic in the inner city are chaotic but relatively slow. So even if something happened, the chance of fatalities are low. But in the countryside people tend to go to maximum speed and beyond. So, if you messed up for a moment is enough for you to die."
"Yeah same. I also felt safer, mainly due to the broader streets (at least compared to Hanoi)"
"That's what I always described Vietnam traffic as. Organized chaos. Even in my parents hometown of Hai Phong before we built all the new roads it was just chaotic. But people still functioned normally.

Saigon is more... Civil due to the infrastructure being able to support all the cars and motorbikes. Ha Noi suffered for a while since their infrastructure was still mostly small and tight.

Ever compared driving in Vietnam vs driving in the west?

For example:

Honking in the west: FUCK YOUUUUUU FUCKING MOVE YOU GOD DAMN IDIOT

Honking in Vietnam: beep beep don't mind me I'm coming up on you. -insert innocent SpongeBob meme here-"
"Similar experience here. When I came back to my hometown, a small city, the behavior with traffic of people was as if the roads were belong to their families’ ownership, or “big roads but still village roads”.

People stop at middle of the road, no turning signal, and f**king teens riding silent electric bikes…"
"Yeah Thailand has a lot more infrastructure and faster roads. Also waaaay more cars. 

Something that dawned on me the other day I noticed in Cambodia, people get cars but they still drive them like Motos if that makes sense, it’s really weird and dangerous."
"You're ignoring the biggest factor - helmet laws. Helmets are required and actually worn in Cambodia and Vietnam and helmets are proven to reduce fatalities. It doesn't mean traffic isn't awful, just fewer people die.  Thailand is notorious for no helmets."
I guess slower traffic and way more motorbikes are  a huge difference….. Singapore higher than VN 🤔
Thailand has probably the highest rate of motor road fatalities. They have a tendency to drive more recklessly and faster than neighboring countries and yes many do drive drunk too.
"It could be that there are more accidents, but they are less fatal. 

My assumption is that there are large numbers of motorbike accidents due to traffic density, but few deaths due to the low speed at which they occur. Plenty of horrific injuries, of course."
"I also find it extremely hard to believe that the road toll here is less than Malaysia and even Singapore.

I'm guessing the reporting of statistics by the famously transparent VN govt is leaving much to be desired"
It's because Vietnam wears helmets and Thailand doesn't. Helmets dramatically improve fatality rates which is what this chart shows.
Well it got better when we have less trucks inside cities.
"2020, no one was driving in VN."
That and helmets. Helmets are required and actually worn in Cambodia and Vietnam unlike Thailand and helmets are proven to reduce fatalities.
"In the cities, there is more knowledge of a healthy lifestyle (or the consequences of smoking a carton of Vinataba/ Chugging Rượu). So many who say they are driving/riding really don’t want to drink that much."
Prob just the most recent data they had
You only scratched the surface. Drunken only accounted for 1-2% of traffic incidents. Zero alcohol law is for and only for pikachu to collect illegal money from poor ppl
"Still low...
Vn, Phil have 100m
Thai has something around 60m?
Indo 300m. You can roughly see the per capita without wiki it."
"For traffic fatalities, Wiki is a little dated but puts Vietnam at around 3/4 the rate of Thailand, which is 5th highest in the world, and with one exception, by *far* the highest outside Africa.  Vietnam ranks 39th, is about 1/3 over the global average and 1/5 over the SE Asia average.  

I've known Thailand traffic is more dangerous than Vietnam's, but I've never seen anything like 11X more injury accidents despite only 2/3 the people.  the 3:4 ratio of per capita traffic deaths is much more in line with the comparisons I've seen before.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_traffic-related_death_rate"
I think you misspelled China.
This.
lol i genuinely dont know if you are trolling
"> everyone knows exactly what's going on and control it

lmfao thanks for the laugh"
"It’s a different approach for sure. I wanted to go to Hồ Thị Kỷ food street my first night there; got to the big roundabout and just sort of gave up. It didn’t help that even after waiting several minutes, I didn’t see anyone else cross either. I got schooled in it the next day. 😅"
"That is definitely one upside of the constant honking. In Anglophone countries when I hear a car honk, I feel like a real piece of shit. In SEA, when I hear a car honk, I know that it's not necessarily personal."
"My VN wife does this too. Wrong side of the street. Creeping out into traffic instead of waiting for an opening. Driving around slower cars, on the left or the right, even when turning. Weaving through traffic. 
A lot of it is not respecting lanes. Lanes seem to be very important in the West. Not so much in SEA."
"Ah, that's a great point. There are more cars mixed with the motorbikes so that probably also contributes to more deadly accidents. 2 motorbikes crashing into each other at low speeds, nowhere near as deadly as a car crashing into a motorbike."
"I've only spent a few weeks in Vietnam and noticed everyone wears helmets and my grab drivers offered me a helmet on every ride.

Living in Thailand I have never been offered a helmet by my grab driver (but I do bring my own.) Everyday I see something on the road the blows my mind and in general where I live, you're in the minority if you wear a bucket."
My assumption is there is a large number of fatalities unreported.
"There's also the fact that Vietnamese people are stubborn and the older generation don't believe in going to the hospital unless they absolutely need to. And even then they'll probably drop by a road side clinic first.

Also that most people are scared of the medical bills and the wait time at the hospital. As well as the old stigma of going to the hospital and contracting something from other patients."
">I'm guessing the reporting of statistics by the famously transparent VN govt is leaving much to be desired

I heard the procedural paperwork to claim liability insurance is too overwhelming so people don't report accident due to the Kafkaesque bureaucracy unless it's fatal."
"I very, very rarely see anyone wearing a motorcycle helmet.  Those helmets most people wear are basically useless in a serious crash and would be illegal in most countries.  They might stop mild abrasions but not serious impacts.

I got into a very minor accident once in China, the ladies helmet split like an egg and made a massive cut down her forehead, she wouldn't have had any injuries if she wasn't wearing that helmet, or wearing a proper helmet."
"Even ""LOL"" cannot describe the laughable nature of your words."
Just don't drink then drive lol. You're salty because you broke the law lmao
"Thanks. OP’s data includes both injuries and deaths, so that might explain the difference."
So you haven’t been to Thailand I see
Yeah and they do that never coming to stop thing.  Like on a moto it’s a convenience thing stopping and starting can be a bit irritating.  Not only does it make no sense in a card that shit is dangerous.
"This makes less sense. Fatalities get reported, it's other things which don't. 

People dying is one thing the state will always be good at recording."
"This wouldn't affect the numbers much. 

The number is for fatalities, not crashes."
This is fatalities not accidents.
"Oh I totally agree that actual helmet quality is still a real issue.  Make no mistake Viet traffic is horrible and there is a long way to go, but at lower speeds even a mediocre helmet is far more effective than your brain hitting the pavement entirely unprotected (think about a bike helmet at bike speeds). There are also a lot more foreigners in Thailand relative to VN who rent scooters, especially in the islands."
"Yep. The ""motorcycle helmets"" used in Vietnam would be more appropriate for riding skateboards. Most of the full-face helmets I've seen were on people with big bikes, but even those are mostly knock-offs, with few sporting any visible DOT or ECE stickers."
The useless one is the only one most people can afford anyway. And it doesn't weigh like an elephant.
Because such a brainwashed kid like you cannot wrap your head with the truth. You can only live in your pinky dream where everything is disney-like life
Assume much?
They don’t have to record them as traffic fatalities.
"Oh. It said casualty I just assumed things like serious injury.

If that's the case then yeah the things I mentioned won't apply.

The low traffic fatality I guess is mostly due to condensed urban centers and thus a general lower in-city speed.

Most people aren't on the highways like they are in western countries."
"Sure pal, you do you."
Very obvious.
"You would need a reason to falsify death records. There's no motivation to say that a road death was another type of death. 

You'll find that Vietnam's death rates don't have any unexplained figures that can only be explained through massaged traffic fatality figures. They'd need to say something else caused the death after all. Does Vietnam have a suspiciously large number of deaths related to falls down stairs?"
"I may have misunderstood what it meant by casualties, to be fair. 

If it's not deaths, my points are utterly irrelevant!

Edit: it's not deaths! Wow!"
"Sure kid, bye"
"If by obvious you mean dumb assumption then yes, you are wrong."
Casualties usually include death and fatal injuries to be fair
Where is your data: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_traffic-related_death_rate. Oh wait you don’t have any. So you haven’t been to Thailand AND you don’t know what you are talking about. Expected.
Haha go away troll.
Wait still don’t have data? Sad.
I dont think you can apply traffic rules in vietnam at all. You just have to learn to walk like a local then 99% of the time u would be fine lol
"How to cross streets in VN:

Step one: Look the way the traffic is going from.

Step two: Raise your hand (Ask to cross, but non-verbally)

Step three: Move forward when see an opening in the ""formation"".

Step three+: For your life, do not walk back, either forward or stop.

Step four: Have fun and don't give a fuck. Traffic rules don't apply in VN.

Don't expect sidewalk to be safe haven either, that is motorcycles' escapes from jams and the way they getting away from cars. A secret here: this is as we call it, the ""Jungle's law"" and it is heavily favoured the smaller ones. If a pedestrian is hit, it is a serious, money and time consuming thing to settle. Thus, motorists are very scared hitting a pedestrian, even cars are."
"Never assume anyone will stop. Cross slowly but assertively (don't stop, dont go back) with a hand raised above your head."
"Can't say anything good about Vietnamese traffic rules. Glad I survived 20+ years with some minor accidents.

I recommend everyone being more careful since TET is near, do you know what is worse than Vietnamese drivers, drunk Vietnamese drivers."
"What's this ""right of way"" that you speak of?"
"As they say, in many countries you are to drive on the right hand side of the road, in some others you are to drive on the left hand side of the road, but in Vietnam, they're just happy if you drive on the road."
Traffic is one of the places where Viet selfishness really shows its face.

"i just had a short trip in HN myself, and, the traffic light here was very, very weird.

your ""normal"" traffic light would be: the pedestrian light will be green for a while when the main traffic light is red, we can now cross the street, simple as that, right?

but no, Ha Noi's traffic light was like: bitch i'd be green for less than 3 seconds, then EVERYTHING WILL BE RED - the pedestrian light will ONLY BE GREEN FOR A TINY DURATION.

i guess people who programmed the light expect us to ... fly across?"
"Best advice is to just be predictable and walk without fear. Drivers here don't know that ""right of way"" shit of respecting pedestrians, so you'll do better surviving the traffic if you follow the general rule of ""dodge whatever is more likely to kill you"", than expect drivers to respect you. 

In fact, most drivers here would rather you respect them, so if you just act really predictably, walk slowly and not backtracking, stand still and don't try to outrun any outcoming cars, trucks,.... you'll do it fine. In fact, you can apply this method to any part of the road, not just the zebra, cause I'm pretty sure most drivers treat the zebra like any parts of the road. 

Though I'd say it's a lot better now since vehicles in big cities rarely run the crossings anymore. Running on the sidewalk only happens when there's a traffic jam, and well...it's understandable for getting stuck in traffic for half an hour would do that to you"
"Another thing is that nobody, not a single one, looks before merging/pulling out into oncoming traffic.
Literally human instinct is to at least look. Some serious single-digit-IQ shit on these roads."
"You keep saying ""right of way""... but that's not really a concept for most Vietnamese people (aside from larger vehicles having more right of way)"
"You're right, but also seem to have the cultural awareness of a stone. Vietnam isn't your country, stop insisting it be something it isn't. I'm reminded of the American woman who lived in my student halls in London. Every other sentence was ""well IN AMERICA...."" and she would proceed to tell us how things are done in America. Highly irrelevant when not in America.

That being said, the roads in Vietnam are truly some of the worst in the world, so your complaints aren't entirely off base."
"LMAO. Thailand actually are more developed and catered to western tourists... Don't know much about Cambodia thou, I was only there as a child. 

Sorry you experienced it. It's half the people's mentality, and half inefficiencies of how police handle it. BUT mainly the roads here are poorly designed and underfunded. It creates many ways to get into accidents. 

YET, i was not hit here by a car yet. I was hit by a car while crossing the street in the US instead. The car made an illegal fast turn. Luckily i am fine. But thinking being in the US was safer than vietnam was a big mistake. Cars here go way slower than cars in the US (in cities at least). If you know how to cross the street here, you're somewhat ok. just keep a consistent speed. 

Vietnam is still a developing country and has a lot more to improve imo"
Right-of-way is not a thing here.
"Honestly the most annoying things were the motorcycles/mopeds going down alleys that are 1-2 people wide and their insistence on riding them through nightmarkets which are already very packed. As a tourist, it was incredibly frustrating that even large nightmarkets stopped (aka, pedestrians sidelining themselves to make way) for these drivers."
"Because they don't know what logic is (on the other hand in Vietnamese to say logical they use either French or a turn of phrase, because it doesn't exist in their way of thinking)... For me the worst aspect of their culture is the complete absence of logic and therefore of understanding that crossing an intersection or a level crossing all together means everyone getting stuck and wasting time... They think they are smart and then end up trapped. Stupid selfishness... Vietnamese are lovable on many occasions but absolutely the worst in the world on the street (I confirm that in Cambodia they are much better)"
"In Vietnam, right of way is ascertained using the following formula: mass times speed"
"as a Vietnamese, just try to dodge the traffic. It's the norm here where people just go."
"I had the same experience after 4months in SE Asia, I found Vietnam traffic was by far the worst, nobody would ever stop to let you cross a street even if your already halfway across they will keep coming at you and at the last second swerve around you. It was ducking nuts"
"worm modern enjoy resolute boat consider cautious repeat ink reply

Adapt or die 🤷
"You do not have right of way in any circumstance - even if there's pedestrian lights and they turn green, and at zebra crossings. 

Super annoying but that's how it is. Just accept that no one follows the rules, and you'll be fine. When you're walking, walk on the sidewalk where you can, and where you can't LOOK OUT for traffic on the road, go onto the road and go back. Cross when there's the lowest number of vehicles as possible, and just walk at a steady speed across. 

It's not that people are intentionally arseholes, but that's how you have to survive when driving. Nothing is enforced, so everyone drives to not die (horn beeping and swerving) and to get to where they need to super fast (going onto the other lane or sidewalk), cause if they don't they'll get into a crash or it'll waste them time."
Ho chi minh drivers are like a 10 and hanoi drivers are like a 3
"The things you have complained about are actually enshrined in law (see luật số 23/2008/QH12). 

The problem is nobody gives a shit about the law, when you can bribe your way out of traffic violations for the price of a cheese sandwich."
Welcome to the jungle
"Your right of way is subordinate to the rights of physics.    If you get hit, the driver will certainly try and evade the scene. If they get caught,   they're not going to have the resources to cover your medical bills.  


Sometimes in life, being right has no point."
"They will try to squeeze right in front of you even those it barely or doesn’t.  Or even cut off a moving car. You chance of getting badly injured is so high. 

That how stupid they are."
"It's not a footpath.  It's a moped parking lot and overflow lane. /s

I have been hit walking in Hanoi.  I mean not hard enough to really injure me but I was hit.  The guy looked at me like I had no business being on the ""side walk"" where the traffic was."
"I have spent over 12 months in Vietnam over the last decade so I understand how to cross a street.

It wears on me and has a cumulative effect.  On my last trip to Hanoi an asshole taxi driver damn near hit me, didn't slow down until he was right on me.  I jumped forward, slipped and skinned my knee.  He stopped and was very apologetic.  That attitude saved him, and probably me some problems.

A few days later, right before the end of my 3 month trip, another taxi was pulling into the curb on Hang Vai,   I was walking at the edge of his path and the guy laid on the horn.  I stepped aside and he stopped with the door next to me.  His window was tinted so I opened the passenger door.  He said ""Sorry, sorry"".

Generally I find Vietnamese people to be quite friendly and polite but some of them get very aggressive behind the wheel."
"....sorry to break it to you but cultural different also apply in traffic. You can get used to it like the local or you gonna endanger yourself and other by being unpredictable(to the local) when in traffic. 

Tip=> when crossing the road just be predictable, dont suddenly speed up or stop in the middle of the road, just move at the same slow steady pace to where you need to be and the traffic will conform to you. The best mental image I can give you is that crossroad moment in the Bee movie."
"Here just some story

About a month ago, I went back to Hanoi to visit my family, I was just riding peacefully around the old quater, like 1.5-2m away from the sidewalk. The guy before me rode really close to an old Westerner couple trying to cross the road (no marked crosswalk and traffic light there) and nearly hit them. The woman really angry and then, when I got close to them (again, they still on the side walk, I'm 1.5-2m away from the side walk), she reached out and hit me in the face with her umbrella. I falled down, my motorbike tripped and scratched badly. Don't have to say, Me and some locals beat the sh\*t out of them then bring them to the police and make them pay for my bike

Yes the traffic in Vietnam is chaotic, but still, we have our own order, you guys just not get used to it yet. Be patient and don't mess up with the local, its normal to us, strange to you guys, what you see is wrong, for us, it's just what it is. But if you guys come here, please be respectful"
Would you like some cheese with all that whiiiiine...
"Vietnamese here and yes, they're a bunch of c*nt"
"Vietnamese think their time worth alot. They need to get to place to sit around and do jack shit drinking coffee or earn less than $5 per hour. 

They have no sense of community. Ni sense of valuing human lives. 

Prove me wrong"
"The problem with talking about the right of way is that you don’t yet understand the psychology of traffic in Vietnam, so your ideas of other countries and their rights of way absolutely don’t apply here. And yes, there are a lot of jerk drivers here too"
Somehow a foreigner said that the Vietnamese traffic was an interesting experience in VTV.
"Watch how the locals cross the street and learn from what they do.

Or just continue to insist that your way is correct and get hit by a bus. Either way is fine."
"I came from CA to Vietnam for a month. Walked a lot. But def don’t expect having “right of way” because you’re a pedestrian. Learn the ways of how they drive and their “signals” of the road. Don’t hesitate but take it slow. If needed put your hand up to let them know you’re crossing. Be wary of cars, if they flash their headlights usually they are saying they want to continue straight! So don’t walk in front of them. I don’t remember much about the mopeds but they are really good at maneuvering! I don’t remember being close to being hit while I was there. But yeah you’re sharing the “sidewalks” with mopeds too so watch out! Also if they are freshly parked watch out for that super hot thing I can’t remember the name of atm, you don’t want to burn your leg (:"
"HCMC is worse than Hanoi, I was in Hanoi for 5 nights and it was pretty okay, had only 1 close call with a bike on the second last day, it’s my second day in HCMC and I’ve had atleast 3 close calls because people are driving like crazies!"
"I'm walking around here in Hanoi right now and sure, it's not really like I can walk comfortably on the side of the road, but I can't really say I feel unsafe. The drivers here will give way for you. You need to trust the drivers here. I think your problem is that you don't trust them, so you panic, thinking that the drivers don't care, and would just hit you. 

The traffic rules here are not really based on explicit rules, but rather by some form of subconscious communication. You walk over a road, you make eye contact with the drivers. You communicate with them and you show intent where you want to go.

Also, I don't really think you should see it that you have the right to any part of the road, say a pedestrian crossing. It seems that wherever you are walking here, expect that there will be scooter and possibly cars. You do not own the road."
The trick is to walk assertively at a constant pace. Try to avoid crossing if you see a car coming right in front of you. Don’t dash or stop in the middle of the road.
"""right of way"". You must be new here."
"I didn't even bother finish reading after your first few sentences.
It's not your right here. Who cares about pedestrian crossings in Vietnam? Just see it as it is and be careful."
"Outside huge cities where mopped drive pedestrians footpath which sucks, I think mopped in vietnam drive pretty good, avoiding everything most of the time.

The real problems are 4 wheels imo, they dont know how to drive at all and are completely unpredictable, doing U-turns absolutely anywhere, going super slow for no reasons, driving miles on the wrong lanes, etc. 

Uturns are the worst tho, hate those cunts, Ive seen 2 teenage girls tbone themself on a van which decided to Uturn where it was clearly prohibited, on a busy street, without checking who was behind. 2 girls ended on the pavement, I tried to explained I was a witness and we should call the cops but the driver was long gone and the girls didnt want to."
"You never need to (or likely will be able to) wait for a gap in traffic in Vietnam. Simply cross when some spaces exist (ideally on a green crossing light), move at a consistent slow but steady pace forwards, do not stop/start or suddenly speed up. 

Trust that vehicles will avoid you (they will, unlike in the West where drivers are not anticipating a pedestrian walking at any given moment and would resort to an emergency stop).

Technically you could close your eyes and walk slowly straight over a pedestrian crossing in Vietnam without incident, such is the culture of carefully weaving around pedestrians. Please do not test my theory though.

I know it doesn’t feel like it, but likely no-one “almost hit you”, it was all carefully choreographed. Think of it as when you walk down a busy street full of people, we often get very close to other people walking the opposite way, but all gently weave around each other without incident.

Embrace the chaos!"
An arms length in vietnam is equivalent to a car length in a 1st World country
"here we go with yet another foreigner who doesn't know anything about vietnam.

right of way on crossing? please, be serious. this isn't Europe, this isn't whatever country you come from. look at local people crossing the road. do you see anyone bothered? or is it just you crying over this? how come local people are okay with it?

&#x200B;

if youre scared to cross a busy street while bikes and cars drive around you, then find a local to teach you it. if you cant even do that then go back to your country. problem solved, no one is going to change because of an upset foreigner. stay foreigner and go away then"
"Everyone drives like this. Embrace it, you're not in your country, learn to embrace the madness, it's fun once you get used to it."
"All I can say is welcome to Vietnam, home of some of the rudest and most uncivilized people on planet Earth."
"Right of way? You are joking right? We are currently in Hue and we were in Hanoi last week, within a day we adapted to crossing streets. Cross the street without back tracking or hesitating. Walk slow and calm. The drivers here do an extremely good job at going around. Stop thinking you are owed the right of way in a different country. If they stopped to give you right of way they would cause way more issues. You really should have done some research before leaving your home country."
"*does no research about how a country works and gets in everybody else’s way*


“But it’s my right of way” 


Gtfo"
"Sounds like New York City. The more crowded the place, the more likely you will run into rude people.

But why are Vietnamese drivers rude? 

It is part of the driving culture meaning that there is no concept of “right of way” nor pedestrian safeguards. Every man for himself, traffic signs and lights are more of a suggestion, and driving safety is not the highest priority."
Tell me you haven't read anything about Vietnam without telling me you haven't read anything about Vietnam.
"First, the Vietnamese  are great drivers.  As you stated, you were never hurt and that is their only obligation to you.

Second, from your perspective the only issue is the one you point out in the second to last paragraph.  Lack of enforcement by the police.  

Grow some balls and you will learn to love cn#ts."
I see skill isue
"Getting mad about not receiving right of way in Vietnam, this is the funniest thing I've read all week, I'm dying, thank you"
"Aside the selfishness, there are facebook groups and forums where people teach each other weird ass driving behaviours, which after generations become common sense here, lol. One such example is the hazardous lights in Việt Nam means ""all must yield to me"". Another is blipping the headlights mean also ""i have asked, so get out of my way""."
Judging by these comments they just accept it. Don't know how I ended up on this post but glad my country has enforced traffic laws and is civilised. I'll keep this all in mind when I visit SEA.
It is hilarious that people come to another country and expect people in that country to behave the same way they do in the original country
"LMAO typical Westerner attitude thinking you can bring your social graces and your civilized way of life bs to another country expecting locals to adopt and obey them. We have our own sets of rules and way of life here. When in Nam, do as the Namese do or else. The streets appear to be lawless at first but there is a rhythm underneath, you just have to tune in. After you get on the same wavelength as the locals, the lawlessness will become a beautiful harmonious dance. You also mention holding the doors for locals and catch them by surprise, that's not bc we're numbed to the rudeness or being rude but bc it is simply not a thing to do here. Get in the door or get away from it, don't dawdle dude."
"It’s a developing country. If it bothers you that much, you don’t have to be there."
I've been here for years and don't see it the way you do at all. Is this your first trip away from home? Do you think because you show up they are going to adapt to what you are used to? There are several flights from multiple airports out of the country everyday you may want to consider getting one to a place that better suits you.
"An arm length? That is more than i expect😂😂, you know maybe u should wait for 2 or 3 second, just make sure no cars or motorbike want to pass then go. Just chill, u won't see them anymore so why u have to frustrate about it?"
Did you hear about that officer that was cut in half by a truck? Yea you wouldn’t see me walking there 😶
I love the driving here. I wish people in the US drove this way. It’s actually one of the first things that made me laugh and think “this place is awesome”
"First. You do no have right of way either on the pavement or crossing the road.

Second. Why don’t you bother to learn the ‘rules’ before shouting your ignorance.

Every where you go in Vietnam it’s the same rule. Outside it’s Every man/woman/child takes care of themselves. You don’t rely on others.


You don’t like it ? Go back to wherever it is you come from. 

In the meantime Have a nice day and enjoy your holiday"
You sound like an entitled butthole. When in Rome.
"Joking answer: skill issue 🐧 git gud

Serious answer: book a cab if you want to go somewhere or hire a guide if you want to wander by foot. I think you are a bit exaggerated, in big city cars rarely run red light anymore so you are safe using crossing path"
The concept of right of way is completely alien here.
"I am from Singapore, we have great infrastructure and the general populace generally follows the rules and laws. Everything is usually in order.   


I didn't get mad about the traffic here (Saigon) as a pedestrian but riding a scooter here is a whole other ball game. I experienced heightened levels of rage due to some of the actions of other road users but eventually got used to it after a short while. I think of myself as being part of the flow of traffic (even on foot) rather than ""THIS IS MY LANE. IT'S MY RIGHT OF WAY."". Someone cuts right in front of me from the left to make a right turn without signals? ""oh, he probably needs to take a shit real bad or something and forgot to signal or wave his hand."".   


I think the key thing about Vietnamese traffic is that it moves like a hive mind and if you're not connected to this, you will experience frustrations within yourself because EVERYONE else is not conforming to your comfort.   


I'm not saying I love the traffic here but as a foreigner if I don't adjust myself, then I will live in rage everyday.. and thats just dumb. 

Most certainly did not feel the need to write a will because of the traffic and I lived here for 7+ years."
"hahaha. 

time for you to fuck off back home."
"walkability in vietnam is a joke, society is also fucked too everyone is selfish and impatient"
"Based in what you wrote you've only been in Vietnam for a very short time. Maybe be less judgemental about a place instead of expecting the same standard as wherever you grew up. The traffic rules are different in Vietnam and the onus is on you to adapt not them.

Here's a basic rule to start. The bigger the object, the more right of way it has. As a pedestrian, you come last most of the time. This isn't about what's right it's about common sense. You want to try and stand your ground on a zebra crossing against a bus? Good luck with that."
"With more tourism and things, these questions will keep coming up. Why oh whyyyy do you nationals not just set a good example and explain why things happen the way they do. Always coming off defensive and rude. It’s so sad when you can easily explain why to foreigners."
"If cops in Hanoi targeted mopeds parked on footpaths the economy would grind to a halt because there would be no mopeds so 90% or transport gone.

You visit a country you experience the good and the bad. Hanoi was chaotic but vibrant. Despite all the chaos I didn't see one crash or one pedestrian hit and it only took a few days to get the hang of walking the streets and crossing roads.

If you want everything to be just like home, stay home."
"poor education, not providing enough knowledge to the people, unstable social order, uselessness of law enforcers. Once one of my friends even talked back to me when I was warning them how dangerous they were driving (jumping red line, reckless driving, driving on the pavement). 😮‍💨

Guess the parents are the problem since kids imitate what they see the society around them."
"TLDR, go back to where you came from"
OP is an idiot who just wants to bitch. Ignore.
Didn't you know this or see videos prior to visiting here. Another high on his horse foreigner again. Don't come back then mate
Once I was walking on this huge sidewalk in Hue. A man parked his car on the sidewalk. When I walked passed his car he somehow turned on the car and almost drove into me. Ofc I gave him the middle finger ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|smile)
For real
The bad news is that the way VN people drive is a good representation of how they are in general.
The difference between a perfect driver and a shit driver is only 1 accident away. Just assume everyone you see driving on the streets now are all perfect drivers
[deleted]
Does that mean your country has the best drivers?  Do show us the accident stats where you’re from.
"When in Vietnam the safest way to cross is to use the traffic like the locals do.
Dont use other countries ""right of way"" methods and get upset that local traffic doesnt follow them.

I hated it when i first arrived but as you get used to the way traffic works here its not terrible.

Goodluck!"
"I can't tell if Vietnamese drivers are great or terrible. Because they drive like fucking idiots, but still manage not to crash most of the time. Maybe we should called it skilled idiocracy."
"My mom was crashed by teenager girls yesterday, she passed the road, those girl saw her passing but they still tried to run over my mom. And, well... fortunately, it's just a small accident"
Ikr it sucks. But Vietnamese myself finds our messy asf traffic interesting and thrilling lol
"Right of way lol, yeah man, you’ll get used to it. Even more fun to drive."
Lmao
"Finally there's a pov from a foreigner visiting Vietnam. The media there ridiculously call the chaotic traffic is an interesting experience, and name the unhygienic food court on the  footpaths as street food culture. 

Honestly, as a student am tend to eat at the cheap food courts on the pavement because the food market offers less tasty foods with a higher price."
"Unlearn everything that you learned about traffic rules and regulations in your country, that's the only way to survive here. I used to get really angry and frustrated about it. It took me a while to understand it, Welcome to Vietnam."
"Unfortunately ‘right of way’ doesn’t exist. I’ve always gone with the thought of whoever has the most lug-nuts, has priority, usually that works. Usually."
"The trick is to be as gormless and ignorant as everyone else. Just use the force and walk. Somehow it works, but I still can’t figure out how. Just walk at a very deliberate and set pace, with no quick deviation."
"Vietnamese 4x4 drivers will plow through the streets at some speed putting everyone in danger, but then insist on taking tiny side road ""shortcuts"" that increase their overall travel time (and everyone else's) by about 30mins."
"I gotta agree that it's worse than Thailand in a way. The thing that gets me is when I have no choice but to walk in the gutter or street, the quiet motorbikes will come up from behind and miss me by a couple of inches. I know they have no intention of hitting me, but I just have to have blind faith that they will not, unless I grow eyes in the back of my head. Somehow it's not as bad in Thailand."
"There is no right of way there, its just a free for all basically."
"In Vietnam, everyone has the right of way… until you don’t."
"Might be you’re right of way in the country you are from but not in Vietnam my friend, it’s on you to stay alive"
The True Nature of Northern Vietnamese ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
you get used to moving here =((( live along you will see normal
"I’d say there are the official rules in Vietnam, and there are the real rules. It’s annoying if you expect them to follow the official rules and try to operate that way, but if you follow the real ones, you should be okay. Others have explained those so no need for me to go into it here. It’s a little nervewracking at first but you get used to it. Or not, but you survive. 

I honestly found it worse in Phnom
Penh. With the sea of motorbikes you can at least see who’s coming. In Phnom Penh it’s motobikes along with huge SUVs (urban assault vehicles) that you can’t see past, and the drivers seem less inclined to figure pedestrians into the equation."
"Yeah it’s crazy but… I never felt like people were being intentionally rude or careless. I actually felt like Vietnamese drivers are about 100x more observant and co operative than drivers in the uk where I’m from. 

HCMC was probably the worst place for traffic though, the pure volume and wide streets makes it harder."
The anger you put out feels very familiar toward vietnamese. I hope every vietnamese feels this not everything is cheery smile coca cola. And in America they hate asian drivers for as long as the car was invented.
"Pedestrians have the opposite of the right of way in Vietnam LOL. In all seriousness, it is very dangerous and one of the things I dislike but accept about VN (to not let it ruin my other positive experiences) cuz of cultural differences."
Vietnam is not Hanoi. Hanoi sucks. Come to Saigon where these things are slightly more bearable
There is no right of way here. It’s sickening but yea it’s the truth
"Just came back to vietnam from the states, riders and drivers still drive like shit. Simply advise is to cope w it. Sincerely, you cant change the whole community in just a snap it has been like this way long before 💀."
"They say: when in Rome, do as the Romans do.

Traffic rules do not apply in VN. One GOLDEN rules of the street is to walk with confidence. Don’t wiggle back and forth. Just keep moving FORWARD and don’t stand in the middle of the road like a pebble. The drivers will avoid you on their own like a school of fish to any predators."
"I'm sorry you feeling this way :) But it's hard to change that. You just have to ""Nhập gia tùy tục"", mate :)"
[deleted]
"Pedestrians are like one of the most ""oppressed"" groups in Vietnam. Sidewalks are used  either as parking space or as buildings' front extension. Crossings are completely disregarded. The police don't care at all because they can't extract bribe from pedestrians."
its part of the culture and charm
Lack of road rage
"Ha, I had managed to stay alive until I escaped this by going abroad for study."
same experience in Vietnam![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
Uhh beginners
"Vietnam driver mentality “me first, fuck you!” Deal with it"
lol as a pedestrian you have no rights in Vietnam. You are at the mercy of everyone driving and it’s best you just walk consistently across the road and let everyone swim around you
"as you said, you've been in asia for 6 weeks. You'll get used it, and you'll come to realise that actually, in VN, the traffic flows better than anywhere in the world given the sheer amount of vehicles on the road given the space. 

as a pedestrian, suck it up, sorry. 

some will say ""developing country"" etc - VN is 20-30 years behind Thailand, and Thailand sucks for pedestrians, so theres really no hope for VN in that respect."
"# Vietnamese drivers suck? YESSSS their are.

Go out at dawn/night time, there are 12/10 total car or motorbikes you meet are turned their high beam headlights. AND THEIR DOESN'T TURN IT OFF"
Lol in VIetnam traffic laws are more like polite suggestions of codes of traffic
I suggest you try a different city
"Just bring a fake gun and cross the road lol? Do you think drivers in VN are friendly and good? Your life or their life choose, they don't give a f care on the people crossing the road just their life."
"Lmfao, first time? 6 weeks might be a bit too long bro..."
Gid gud
"You got a bad dose of culture shock. There is no ""right-of-way"" in Vietnam, well nothing that is enforced. Just forget about all that bullshit from the west about rules-of-the-road and polite driving. It's every man for himself. Imagine an aerial dogfight. I've come to the conclusion 75% of the folk using the road have never passed a driving test. They don't use indicators. It is very common for an indicator on a scooter to be left on accidentally, because the rider is so focused on what is happening ahead. So you cannot believe an indicator. A lot of car drivers have graduated from bikes to cars wihout passing a test and they continue to drive as if they are on a bike ie stop in middle of road, no indicators, u-turns, no looking before pulling out in front of oncoming traffic etc

BUT.....

once you wrap your head around the insanity you realize  the traffic actually keeps moving. Everybody is very focused on what is ahead. So if there is an unofficial right-of-way it is the guy in front can do what he wants and it's up to you not to hit him. Also, average speeds are real slow, say 20-30kph.

If a granny pulls out from a side road without looking ( which is standard operating practice) and you squash her - it will be your problem. 

As a result, nobody assumes they have right-of-way and   there is a remarkable lack of road rage. Look at the faces ( if you can see behind the darkened glass), you see concentration more than anger. So compared to USA, nobody is getting worked-up. Except for foreigners🤣🤣.

Btw dont try challenging a truck!"
"The right of way in Vietnam is the ""me first"" mentality."
"In Vietnam, Traffic light color rules as follows, green = go, yellow = go and red = go"
"USE YOUR FREAKING HANDS TO ASK THEM TO GIVE U SOME SPACE, JUST RAISE YOUR HAND (not too high, around your hips) AND WALK STRAIGHT WHILE STILL HAVE EYES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE STREET AND THAT IT. NO LOCALS TEACH YOU THAT????? OR YOU JUST DONT KNOW HOW TRAFFIC IN VIETNAM WORKS XDDDDDD"
"Dude, wtf stop crying lol. As a tourist you need to adapt… they don’t have to change their lifestyle because you are in their country. If things works that way, like it or not, suck it up.
In my country, drivers respect and will stop at the  pedestrian crossing, but I learned how to cross a street in Vietnam in the very first day I got there. 
Stay home if you don’t want to live with cultural shock dude."
Lol that's normal in vietnam. There's even a scene in a recent movie 'a tourists guide to love' where the main character is visiting vietnam can't cross the street and the tour guide teaches her how to do it
"Yeah, traffic in Vietnam is a big mess. Growing up here, it still worries me sometimes, but never have I ever been hit by anything. From experience, here is what I can tell you:

1. Try to obey the rules as much as you can, tries to walk in a group or follow local to cross road.
2. Don't worry, as long as you walk in a consistent speed and predictable direction, nothing will hit you. If you're scared, walk slower.
3. Watch out for the bus stop, buses can swoop in and out very, very fast.
4. You don't have to walk in the gutter. Just walk on the inside edge of the road, it's fine."
"There is no such thing as pedestrian footpath. Your mind is warped from the west. In the west, pedestrians have right of way. In the jungle, bigger size wins. Motorbikes are bigger so you must yield to them on the sidewalk or become run over. Don't like it? Rent a truck, now the Motorbikes must yield to you."
"Learn the culture and don't hate. Just because you feel a sense of entitlement does not mean they are c**ts.  Educate yourself before you go to a country. Each country has the good and the bad. 
Traffic laws do not apply in Vietnam. There is no righter way for pedestrians like in the west. You just need to watch out for cars. Mopeds can go around easily."
"You get used to it. There's a method to the madness.

They're not all c***s. I mean some are! But the same as everywhere. It's just how things are done - people follow the local code. Why do people park on pavements? Because there's nowhere else to park and it's bloody convenient! Why don't people care about pedestrian crossings? Well they sort of do - they'll just weave to avoid you instead of stopping for you.

Different culture and what not. What seems rude and mad to foreigners is just life in Vietnam. My Japanese friend was horrified by the way people queue for a drink at the pub in England - thought it was very rude and unpleasant... it never even crossed my mind that it could be an issue. The same qith traffic in Vietnam. Everyone knows the system and it works 

If you lived in Vietnam you'd get used to it and stop noticing very quickly. If you're just visiting then you'll have to grin and bare it. Just focus on all the amazing food!"
"Haiya, it might take a long time to make traffic in VN more civilized. For now we must accept that is one of VNese culture and learn how to get along with that.
Im VNese and sometimes I also feel annoyed with traffic in Vietnam.
Ps: Wish you have other beautiful memories in Vietnam except traffic, of course."
"I know this may upset a lot of people but Ho Chi Minh city people are overall better. Traffic may be   bad the same, but there are way more entitled people in Hanoi than in HCMC. Dont judge the whole Vietnam."
"I just visited VietNam and HCMC, and I 100% waited until a local would get ready to cross the street or cut through traffic in some way. And I'd follow them. I figured I'd do something stupid or walk somewhere stupid and get run over."
The traffic cops out to nail you for coffee money for doing even the most minor infractions would like to disagree lol
99% is too high.
You say it like you’re proud of it.
"I find traffic to be much more efficient in Viet Năm. Los Angeles may have rules, but when you’re stuck on the “freeway” some weekends you just turn off your engine because you won’t be moving for awhile. Hà Nội moves how many people down fewer streets much more effortlessly."
"The cows seem to manage ok. Just repeat:

""Im smarter than a cow...im smarter than a cow..."""
"Agreed! Walking in traffic in Hanoi was one of my favorite things to do while there! Never had an issue, and I was just there last month."
"And really, it looks chaotic at
first but it’s actually like a flock of birds or a school of fish. Everyone is very aware of their surroundings and though accidents aren’t unknown, it’s not nearly as common as one might think. 

I’m honestly more nervous in the US where, at least in my city, traffic enforcement seems almost nonexistent. You really can’t assume you’re safe just because your light is green."
"So dumb

No country do this"
Do not make eye contact with
piss on the road to assert dominance.
Dont forget those racing bois
"Right next to ""Yielding"" another mythical concept only rarely practiced during leap years. Maybe."
Yea I know it sucks but don’t expect to have “right of way” in Vietnam.
whoever is fastest has the right of way :D
a western traffic concept OP just believes they are entitled to and follows them in a magic bubble wherever in the world they might be walking.... Like a decree from God
Some mythical bubble shield that's supposed to make pedestrians invulnerable because Westerners are taught that the road belongs entirely to pedestrians
Look it up yourself 🙄 pretty basic traffic law
The road is where you see Social Darwinism in practice.
"Some people are bloody lovely, but it's like every single person has road rage the moment they're on a bike or in a car. I feel like I need to start carrying a big fucking stick. 

I've had some very surprised looks when I've held open doors for locals etc. as if basic kindness is new to them, so yeah it seems Vietnamese are generally very rude and inconsiderate."
"This is why they don’t get tourists back like other countries 

They wondering why"
"focus on the traffic light, not the pedestrian light. Traffic light is all that matter here, everything else is just mainly for decorative."
">i guess people who programmed the light expect us to ... fly across?

They expect people to violate the rules so that somewhere down the road, the traffic cops will show up and give out fines (There are many such cases)"
Best advice is to just take taxis if you don't want your feet ran over. My worst accident here happened by a motorbike clipping me on a sidewalk.
"Human instinct is to look, but they're still learning how to human here in VN"
"Right of might. Don’t fuck with large trucks because they do not yield, ever."
"Remind her, the saying goes “when in Rome do as Romans do”"
"If your culture involves flattening a few pedestrians a day and unsafe roads, maybe it deserves calling out."
"a stupid European mentality, they wonder why their traffic sucks and they have chronic road rage... its because of ""right of way"""
"We are the worst. 

Even cambodia or Lao is better."
And also make sure that your velocity vector is always positive
Thank you. Was starting to believe nobody in Vietnam saw a problem with this.
There is no need for  /s as it's literally the new law now with privatization of sidewalks in town
"You have right of way laws, you just don't follow them."
They are being nice. They vote w their wallet
"I agree. I lived in Hanoi for 6 years, and figured this out in my first few days there"
"Yeah that’s the way to go but it doesn’t work all the time.

When I was in Vietnam there were several close calls with people using phones when riding, and they were going right into my path. I had to stop or they would’ve crashed into me.

It’s “omg chaos but it works” until it doesn’t. There’s a reason Vietnam has a significantly higher number of road fatalities than average, even though they drive super slow."
"""The drivers here do an extremely good job at going around. "" 

That is IF they see you.  
The way you describe crossing the street is the only viable option, but your tone suggests to me that you are putting way too much faith in the drivers/riders to be aware and not playing on their phones."
"Stupid mentality 

Have fun staying poor"
">But why are Vietnamese drivers rude? 


Communism."
Clearly. Its fucking ridiculous.
Walking in NYC is a piece of cake compared to Hanoi. Pedestrians actually have right of way in NYC and most people respect it.
This person is going to hate driving here 🤣

"Define what it means to be a ""great driver"" haha,
Objectively, Vietnamese are among the worst drivers in the world.

They are great drivers in Vietnam, but would be an absolute disaster anywhere else in the world (perhaps bar some locations in India)"
"I remember Taipei circa 1991. It was still a haven for bicycles and motorbikes back then, and unofficial  traffic laws were almost similar with VN now, with people crossing wherever and whenever and motorbikes use the sidewalks. Fast forward to 2023, Taiwanese people are now disciplined as they admitted their wrong ways and accepted valid or constructive criticism from the outside world. You will see that Taipei traffic system is similar to Tokyo now with most (if not all) people respecting traffic laws, except that drivers drive too fast."
That is such an original comment. Did you come up with that all by yourself?
"Don't like it, leave... did you come up with that brilliant idea all by yoruself? I've honestly never seen it used in every fucking expat forum on the Internet."
"Just dont listen too much about those cmt which say traffic rules do not apply for Vietnamese, IT DOES, but every cross line have 20 or 30 sec of green light for walker, u have 30 sec. So wait for few sec can't be that hard, right? For ur safety first😉"
You might be functionally retarded.
yeah? how long have you been living here?
"But it's in your laws lmao. Basically you've said ""fuck you we don't follow our own traffic laws or properly enforce anything because the police can be bribed"".

Is that how you want things to be?"
"Don't like it, leave... did you come up with that brilliant idea all by yoruself? I've honestly never seen it used in every fucking expat forum on the Internet."
"Because I don't want to die on a road, or because I know when I have right of way? Or is it because I expect fellow humans in another country to have some basic sense of consideration, decency, and respect? Yep, total butthole attitude."
"Cars don’t run red lights but scooters do. I’ll be on the back of a Grab and feel my rider getting antsy after like 5 seconds of being still.

In cities with lots of traffic like HCMC it’s mental, albeit they’re pretty good at backing off running lights once a pedestrian starts walking."
"Common sense would indicate a cultural movement towards not driving like a pillock so you can cross roads safely.

OP could've grown up in any other country pretty much and find this appalling. Defending breaking your own laws as well."
"You are actually using the phrase ""common sense"" in relation to Viet traffic? Hilarious!"
"The traffic rule is not that different, and pedestrian does not come last. If you are ride or drive in Viet Nam, I advice you to revise the law on road traffic, especially articles 11. Basically you will have to yield to pedestrians, with or without zebra crossing painted on the road."
">Despite all the chaos I didn't see one crash or one pedestrian hit 

And i live here and have seen multiple fatal crashes lol. Neither cases of anecdotal evidence is helpful though. Statistics dont lie though.

Also the whole ""stay home if you dont like the difference"" take is hilarious, people like to act like Vietnam is still in the 90's economically. VN is still a developing nation sure but it has had yeaaaars of development at this point, plenty of avenues to implement some long term thinking or planning.

And they have not. There's very little wrong in pointing out how grossly mismanaged this country is. Especially when the direct result is deadly/harmful to its populace.

I mean shit, you can clearly see the lack of prioritizing education in threads like these :)"
"Parents are absolutely part of the problem; a HUGE part of it, indeed. There is very little good parenting going on in VN. Children raising children raising children."
🤡
"Username checks out. A Vietnamese for sure.

Bad driving by dumbphucs are bad driving."
"Exactly. The western sphere keep saying that Vietnamese are smart, hardworking and whatever... are you kidding me... the way they drive, that's exactly what they are."
"the US is hardly a developed country, especially when it comes to non-car infrastructure.

Try walking in just about any major city in Europe, grab a bike in Holland/The Nordics and see what that's like lol.

"I'm from the UK so 2.9 deaths per 100,000 people compared to Vietnam's 24.5

That's over an 8 times higher death rate."
"Well no doubt western countries do protect drivers from accidents better with will designed roadways and better rule. compliance.  

But interesting enough because of efficient roadways, speeds are much higher and accidents more often result in a death. Even when adjusting for population and vehicle usage. 

That said one can easily eat, drink, put on makeup, and all sorts of nonsense while driving a car in the west, due to the organization of traffic."
"100x more observant ? 

Getting out of a junction onto a straight road with those on the straight road having the right away, without even looking and forcing those who have the right of way to brake hard and causing a congestion. 

That's observant and cooperative? 

No. That's a tell tale sign of dumbphucs! Stop enabling stupidity and selfishness."

"Road deaths are out of control in Vietnam. A lot of people say that about Thailand ""the traffic just flows"".  


It does not. Go look at the emergency room at any hospital. Full of people (also locals) for whom the traffic did not ""flow""."
"Vietnam's traffic flow is efficient because most of the vehicles are motorbikes. There is a complete disregard for pedestrians and traffic lights. Just wait till 50% of the population has a car. No one's going anywhere in this city.

LA's traffic is messed up because car and oil companies lobbied against mass transportation like subways and speed rails. Instead they got freeways on top of freeways."
"Ahh yes, look at [this model of efficiency](https://i.redd.it/7c5hrpf2tdob1.jpg). So efficient that it literally has [double the amount of road deaths compared to the US](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/road-deaths-by-country)

Traffic in Vietnam is one of those things that works until it doesn't, and when it doesn't, it's an absolute shitshow. The ""me first"" attitude can be infuriating and it's gotten to the point where I can barely go 4 or 5 minutes without cussing another driver out under my breath as I'm driving. For the sake of my own sanity, in 2022 I moved close enough to work that I can walk and I rarely drive more than 5-10 min. I'm most likely moving out of Vietnam this coming summer and while the move is mostly out of a desire for a change of scenery and new experiences, the traffic here is definitely a factor in my decision (and moving somewhere with good public transit so I don't have to drive is a big priority because of the shit here). 

I'm gonna go out on the limb and guess that you haven't been here more than a year or two, probably less, right? I don't mean to be condescending, but I've been here for about 7 years and the only people I ever hear make comments like yours are people who are fairly new to the country. Foreigners who have lived here long term either hate the traffic or accept it; they never say praise it. Give it time and I'm sure you'll be singing a different tune."
"LA is a poor example. If you want to choose a Western comparison, let’s choose London, Munich, Berlin, Amsterdam, Stockholm. Or for that matter, let’s choose Asian comparisons: Osaka, Singapore, Seoul, Hong Kong.

There are no excuses for Hanoi’s traffic, fun though it may be once you’re used to it. It isn’t better than LA and LA is, in any case, scraping the absolute bottom of the barrel of the Western world, traffic-wise."
Yeah people are wayyy better at self aware when they arent inside a metal box and crashing mean both gonna eat up the asphalt lol
"In my experience, Viets are some of the least self-aware people on the planet. They might know what is 1 meter DIRECTLY in front of their motorbikes, and completely oblivious to everything else."
"I felt the same in Egypt. Because in Western countries they expect the rule of law and most people follow it when unexpected things happen people are surprised and not used to reacting and accidents happen. In these other places people know anything can and will happen so we're all aware of each other all the time and just make way or swerve or whatever.

It looks like madness but it's like you said about flock of birds there's some organic method and order there."

Shut up you idiot. What the are the pedestrian crossings and traffic lights for on the roads here?>? decoration??? its part of the driving test here.
"In ""the west"" we're actually taught how to drive properly, like, looking over our shoulder to check our blind spot before making any movements, and stopping for pedestrians at zebra crossings. It makes our roads a lot safer, more enjoyable, and less stressful to drive on. We do these things, not just for our own safety, but for the safety of other people around us, because we actually care about all of our lives. It seems Vietnamese don't really seem to give a shit."
Not the road. OP was commenting on sidewalks and zebras.

They don't get ragey easily. This kind of driving is normal. It's all so slow that at least there is usually time to stop. The only person I've had shout at me was another expat on some motorbike who was trying to overtake me on a bridge at high speed.
"Opening the door is often times look at as you currying favours, or suck up, or simping, or trying to flirt with the one you open the door for (good if you are a couple; 50/50 they see it negatively/creepy if not), or even a warning ""I held power over you"". Or it could be an area with a lot of EU or US expat and they can tell.

Unless the targets really can't open the door themselves or you are very specifically the door opener guy (could be a security guard). Your intension is often put into question. You are not expected to open the door for other people.

It's not inherently considered a kindness."
"Opening door isn’t being considerate or not, just cultural differences. People don’t expect you to do that, and you doing that will make people think twice about your intention. You can be considerate without opening door for people or faking a smile to everyone you meet."
"Road rage is not a thing here. What are you talking about? The only people I see raging are foreigners (myself included) reacting to the bullshit drivers.  


What you said about them being rude and inconsiderate is spot on. No everyone, of course, but runs rampantly throughout the culture."
"Bikes and cars kinda flow like water, they dont stop and they dont hit, assume this and dont interrupt the flow."
Don't hold doors. That's creepy as fuck here.
Cuz the tourist is 6 feet under?
"Focusing on the traffic light is a good way to get run over, because there’s tonnes of drivers who will ignore it and drive anyway. Watch the traffic light only until it’s time to cross, then watch the traffic like a hawk."
yeah you either stay away or ya dead ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
"Or ""when in London, just stfu"""
Yeah what is this defensive stance lol
"No, fuck off with that western thinking"
the alternative is gridlock. VN traffic flows.
"The US literally has the most car accidents in the world and people in Vn dgaf about the traffic. Tourists being ethnocentric and spreading negative stereotypes about a whole ethnicity of people is so ignorant. OP isn’t entitled to a thing, quit acting stuck up and go home lol. “Right of way”, embarrassing."
Cambodia for sure.  I dunno Laos
If you know this then it shouldn't be a surprise. Act accordingly. The world doesn't owe you anything.
"Yeah because you need to make eye contact with the driver to know they see you, otherwise you stop for a second and let them go. That's just how it works. 90% of the time you could cross the road with your eyes closed and everyone would avoid you. Entitled tourists expecting things to be the same as at home need a reality check. 

>There’s a reason Vietnam has a significantly higher number of road fatalities than average

But less than, for example, neighbouring Thailand where people drive much faster, don't wear helmets and even though there are less bike and more car owners. If you had the same amount of bikes vs cars in other countries there would be more deaths too because bikes are more deadly if you crash."
Have fun staying ignorant!

"Yeah, I've read up and have a Viet friend, so I didn't get too pertubed during my visit. 

Although I haven't driven in Hanoi or HCM, I've done so in Ninh Binh (pretty intense), Da Nang (medium) and the countryside (easy).

Can Tho traffic is something I experienced today, but it didn't feel that bad. Might have just gotten used to it now.

Just walk like you own the place, make eye contact and glare like you are their mortal enemy."
"Lol, I was thinking, ""Everyone hates crossing the streets but I'm dreaded about changing lanes and turning left at green light."" 🤣 

I was born and grew up in VN, I biked too. But now it's worse with more cars in the mix."
"If you felt people were running you off the road I'd guess you were probably also staring at your phone or not paying attention. Vietnamese drivers are way more considerate of pedestrians being in the road than most other countries I've visited. If you had a hard time it's because you didn't adapt properly. Just need to walk slowly, predictably and be considerate of others and you will be absolutely fine. The tourists I see having issues are the ones who rush around trying to pass other pedestrians when there isn't room, they could just slow down and have a way nicer holiday."
Ok.  Ok.  It was a tongue in cheek comment... although I am not going to say which cheek or whose.
Do you think you are going to come to some else's country and change it? You will only end up offending your hosts and make yourself angry and bitter.
"Yeah you're right, much better in America where you get shot by the cops for j-walking"
definitely a retarded comment they made
"That's a whole lot of things you just made up there. Do you think people bribe the cops every time they don't stop at a pedestrian crossing lol? Laws are not the same as commonly accepted rules. I'm sure in your country most people drive above the speed limit on the highway, does that mean ""fuck you we don't follow our own traffic laws""?"
It’s not an ex pat forum though
No because you bring with you a predisposed attitude of how things should be rather than going native.
Im vietnamese and youre correct with your statement. People' attitude towards traffic law is bad and sad. No amount of cope can justify it. Ignore the losers
Most Vietnamese cities literally would stop functioning if they adopted western traffic laws. The roads simply aren't big enough. I cross the road safely by effectively telegraphing my action to cross in the same way the locals do. Common sense is following the rules like the locals not imposing your own.
"That's because they buy into the fake ""friendly"" smiles."
"LOL. Tankies?  How about people just don’t like entitle foreign trash complaining while taking advantage of low cost of living?

Again they should show us their traffic casualties and compare."
HOLY shit.  Vietnam is close to Africans as the worst drivers. LOL.
"Good for you. 

When Vietnam decide to change its driving culture. They will do in their own terms and not because some foreign Karen demanding to see the manager.  

For a first world country like UK. Why does your crime rate only a bit lower than a developing country like Vietnam?   Fix your own problem before pointing fingers at others or maybe that’s what entitle europoor does. Just bitch."
"You're assuming the right of way. Whether officially or not, Vietnamese have taken the ski slopes approach, those behind are responsible for not hitting those in front. I had lengthy conversations with grab drivers, ordinary citizen drivers etc regarding this and that is the system they follow. The problem is when someone doesn't follow the system.

As a pedestrian everyone will tell you to keep putting one front in front of the other, why? Because it is an agreement with the the oncoming traffic they will avoid you, it is if you try and run to avoid them or go backwards you will run into trouble.

Experienced drivers in Vietnam know how it works, and they work together to avoid accidents, there is no 'right of way' you just don't hit those in front of you. Same as walking. Do you walk straight into people who cross your path because you were going in a straight line? No you, you go around or slow down. It's really not hard to grasp.

No one should be breaking hard ever if they are driving Vietnamese style. You control your speed throughout. Take it from someone who broke too hard and has the scars to prove it. You know why that happened? I was too close and going too fast, I was at the back and not paying sufficient attention, it was my responsibility not to need to break hard. Yeah that person shouldn't have suddenly stopped for no reason, but ultimately the buck stopped with me, I was at the back, I should have had my eyes on the situation and always left enough distance to be able to break safely.

Vietnamese even go one step further out of courtesy. You know how loud it is? All the beeping? That's communication, thats saying, I am near you, I am coming up on your left/right, watch out. They don't need to do that, but they do. Far more co operative system than in the west and requires far more observation and understanding of each other. Where we beep out of anger and as a reaction, which is basically useless.

I stand by my statement and look, I've managed not to accuse anyone of being 'dumbphucs' or stupid in the process."
I deleted as it was TMI but yes the lack of planning and thought of consequences is maddening
Unless you’re an official or something then in which case you get to see the yellow dogs shit their pants lol
How much should you give them
">LA is also literally one of THE WORST cities itw when it comes to traffic.

I'm guessing you've never been to Jakarta on a Friday."
"Hopefully the metro will finally be built and further projects started. Not only do they cut down traffic, but they also give you much more space for everything in the city.

In bangkok, you have all of these huge sky malls that are connected to major bts stops. You'll start to see more high rise condos built alongside those metro lines.

I really think a running metro system would change saigon and hanoi in a lot of ways."
I guess I’ve never been to Vietnam then. Where I drive people mostly stop at red
"Well, it is an every man/woman for themselves situation and everyone is trying to get to their destination. On top of that, they are trying to move forward. Therefore, to prevent sensory overload, from all the smokes and horn, they just care what is in front of them because that is the way they are trying to move towards. That is why you have to raise your hand when crossing the road. Raising hand is kind of saying, ""Sorry for obstructing, Thank you for your understanding"" an of course, make yourself more stands out from the traffic ahead of the rider."
"Same here in the Philippines, I call it the hive mentality."
"You really want your kids to grow up in this environment?

Like constantly fear of being killed any moment?"
I added it as step 3++
Reking boys
"i'd argue that cars here tend to HAVE TO give way to scooters here. Whether or not the scooter survives the outcome or any impact is a different story but the cars/trucks tend to stop/wait for them, hence the unofficial ""right of way"" to the faster vehicle. i could be wrong though!"
"Correct, that's how it works in Vietnam."
"Hate what exactly?

Could you imagine the even worse mess the roads would be in if everytime a pedestrian stepped into a crosswalk all the traffic had to stop short until they crossed.
Certainly this is all poor infrastructures fault, but the concept of pedestrian right of way just doesn't work with roads that are already so inadequate"
"Well if you can link me to the law then apparently not... Otherwise, just trust me bro"
"  They are a suggestion. Unless you can point be to the actually law that starts vehicles need to yield to pedestrians.
And no one was taking about right off way at a red.  So sick a dick fayg."
"Many in vn are looking over their shoulder as well, people don't want to be hurt in a traffic accident. the numbers are just amplified and often we run into the few who doesn't or forgets to. 

You can't compare sparse traffic conditions or well designed roads in the west. That shit happens in the cities in the west as well.

My grandfather didn't look or use mirrors at all. That was fine for the small town he lived in with no traffic and open roads, but its the same behavior you're complaining about here.

Every single person doesn't want to an accident, and for the amount of traffic in the city there is a surprisingly small number of them. 

But you're waiting your distaine in the wrong area, there's no where in the world with this terrible road infrastructure, number of vehicles and organized traffic."
"Oh, the zebras and sidewalks

Yeah, that totally sucks, but what can we really do about it? Hanoi is way too crowded for a city of its size, roads not large enough to encompasses that amount of traffic, and most of the times police officers would rather camp near an alcohol restaurant for pocket money instead of doing anything about this problem. 

It's understandably maddening to be stuck in a 2km traffic jam for 2 hours that everyone would prefer whatever alternatives they can find

Though zebras is....yeah, thats asshole behavior on the drivers part. 
Unless OP decided to cross the zebra on red light thinking it's okay, then they're the asshole in this case"
"Oh my bad then, very hilarious indeed"
"hm, im glad i read this cuz the couple times i've held doors open it's been met with what seem like some very friendly bows and hurrying through. luckily they were around my age so i think that helped, but good to know it can be read badly."
cars flow like water? that's certainly not the case in the capital lol
Or the tourist doesn't want to be 6 ft under
Ngu
"the op comment was saying something along the line of ""i only walk when pedestrian light is on"" so i said the traffic light is all that matter. Ofc look at the traffic flow for unsuspected redlight assholes too"
"Nah, don't focus on the lights, focus on the vehicles. Keep your speed steady and passing the street regardless of lights. Needless to say, stay away from high speed vehicles as well."
"This is wrong. Where I'm from, there are 2.9 deaths on the road per 100,000 people  (UK). In the US it's just over 12. In Vietnam it's 24.5

That is massive and puts you on par with the other most unsafe countries.

Why just make shit up when you don't know the stats? Your own people die in road accidents every day.

Right of way is also written into your own laws, and pretty much every other country's laws too, you're just ignorant of them."
Have fun never enjoy nice things
The argument that people there are cunts because everyone else there is also a cunt is a new one. Doesn't sound like the best defense but we'll see how it goes down.
[deleted]
"Please, share with us one story where cops shot someone for j-walking. Please do. Police in the US are mostly assholes and are getting worse, but I'm curious to learn about this j-walking execution of which you wrote."
The light was red. Natives put that red light there for some reason. It wasn't him installing that traffic light there.
Great statement.  Foreigners coming in thinking every corner of the world should follow their standards.  Entitlement is crazy.
"What are the red lights and pedestrian crossing for? decoration???  it's part of the driving test here. 

Vietnam has one of the highest road deaths ratios in Asia, Be it from drunk drivers or just your random uneducated bike driver.

When in Rome doesn't cut it either. This country has regressed after covid and needs all of the foreign investment and tourists it can get. S"
You sound like a conservative. Just because that’s how things always are doesn’t mean there’s no need for changes or improvements. The guy made a reasonable point of how selfish and careless people are on their motorbikes. So don’t go around pulling the “when in Rome” to justify the lack of decency. Fuck that.
"Vietnam has a death rate of 24.5 people per 100,000 from road accidents, which is really high as much as people in this thread have claimed the drivers are skilled and deaths don't really happen.

Obviously I would cross as the locals do so I don't die. But not even acknowledging the problem and refusing to entertain the idea of enforcing traffic laws and teaching children about traffic laws in school is sad."
Don’t complain about being run over?  Really?
How dare I want people not to die lmao
Crime is already punished. If someone murders we punish it appropriately. Not much else we can do. Deaths as a result of stupid driving culture though? That can be fixed easily.
"Yes you manage not to, but that still doesn't change the fact that they are dumbphucs. This country has laws and right of way exist in the traffic law. Yes you can say all that in your long ass argument, still doesn't change the fact that the law applies. If you get into an accident, the right of way will be applied. How do I know ? I manage to sue a motorcyclist bankrupt because he violated my right of way and caused an accident. I'm going straight, he's turning out of a corner. Not my business to brake. He slammed into me. Hard. But he bare all the damages to my car and his own hospital bills. (:  told him this your lesson for driving without brains. Laws exist in Vietnam and it applies when shit happens."
200k
Yea it's a real shame Vietnam can't build something as simple as a metro. Singapore and S. Korea have the best metro system IMO. Everything is connected underground so you can avoid the heat or rain. Vietnam is quickly becoming a place foreign companies are investing in. There's going to be a rising middle class who purchase cars.
"This is a recently occurring thing, 10-15 years ago no one did"
"I mean, who really does? The problem is that the environment is that way. You have to adapt to the environment or become something that can change it. Before our children can become someone significant of the country that can change the environment. If you have the means or ability to get out of the country, get out and stay out, I congratulate you. If not, you have to learn and teach your kids these ""survival skills"" or else they have to adapt on their own or die. It is like in animal kingdom. An organism have desirable traits to survive will survive and have more kids who have the same or better trait to survive in the environment. The one who don't die and get removed from the gene pool by Natural Selection. The difference here is that you have the ability to migrate to other region and try survive there without adapting to this environment."
"No, that's going to school in America. In SE Asia you just learn to live with a lot less social distance and go with the flow."

"**2. Regulations on giving way to pedestrians in Vietnam**  
**Regulations on giving way to pedestrians under Clause 4, Article 11 of the Law on Road Traffic 2008 are as follows:**  
  
**At pedestrian crossings, operators shall observe, slow down and give way to pedestrians and wheelchairs of the disabled to cross the road.**  
  
**At places where there is no pedestrian crossing, operators shall observe and, if seeing a pedestrian or a wheelchair of a disabled crossing the road, slow down and give way to the pedestrian or the wheelchair of the disabled to safely cross the road.**

Average ppl who take a joke way too seriously..
"I said Most! As in last year, 42,795 road deaths occurred in one country, 6,400 in the other. Our stats given are besides this point. 

Laws are bs. 

Re-read OP’s post/comments. We’re speaking ab ppl coming in to OUR home, with no knowledge on etiquette. Calling “general Vietnamese people” rude, selfish, etc., j bc they don’t know how to cross the damn street that locals cross daily? 

Idk why y’all debating the issues of smaller world countries in this CULTURAL talk, irrelevant and only defense dug up for being ethnocentric. Even if, the traffic system is such a minuscule issue compared to others"
"Do you find yourself overtaking other drivers a lot? I see tourists all over SEA driving way faster than the locals. Same thing I said about walking slowly and predictably as a pedestrian applies to driving too. Not saying you're one of them but lots of people don't adapt their driving and still have the western mentality of getting to the destination as fast as possible, everyone else be damned."
[California police filmed shooting man dead after jaywalking](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/california-police-shooting-jaywalking-video-b1806614.html)
If the standard is “dont run over pedestrians” that seems reasonable?
"you people will defend anything wont you 😂😂 traffic and traffic attitudes in Vietnam are a joke even compared to its SEA peers. 

Dont be like this you're making people look bad lol"
"Excuse me? This happens in every third world country. So why should it be different in Vietnam?
If you travel, you wouldn't be sitting here shitting on the driving culture because it happens everywhere.
If you think otherwise then you are sadly mistaken."
"Who are you to assume what I am? If anything, you sound like a conservative.
I'm saying that this happens everywhere and not just Vietnam so why do you think it should  e different?"
"It's not sad it's a different culture. The government controls the laws and it's slowly making progress to enforcing them but it's not the same solution as in the west. You make it out like it's simple - you are wrong. There's no vehicle mandated maintenance so a lot of those accidents are down to that. Sometimes there are drunk drivers. Most people don't have insurance. The helmets offer no protection. Most vehicles are bikes not cars. 

Just a few reasons that I randomly thought of. Frankly, Reddit annoys me with people mouthing off like their country is superior. If you think that don't go to Vietnam stay home where you can sit on your high horse and nobody will argue with you."
"Hahahaha  guess the Vietnamese crossing street culture isn’t for you. It takes a little courage to walk them streets. Not everyone has it.  When you leave Vietnam, please take your foreign entitlement with you."
"Punish?  If someone murder a family member of yours, they get life sentence, another words 15-20 years.  Meaning they will be release one day and can piss on the grave of their victims. Guess that’s punish appropriately.  

Again Vietnam is build for Vietnamese.  Don’t need any europoor Karen to bitch about their society. If you don’t like it. Peace!  Go back to eating fish and chips LOL"
"So who exactly isnt using their brains here? Because you saying it’s not your business to break because some rules say so doesn’t seem very smart, that could result in your death as much as anything else, but you’re gonna go for it anyway cos the rules said you could? 

I don’t think it’s very smart to drive blindly because some governing body somewhere made a rule that you’ve got ‘right of way’, you should always exercise your own judgement and assume not everyone is going to be following the rules, whether it’s out of choice or because they made a mistake. You can’t sue if your brain is splattered all over the road."
"And for how long has powered vehicles been common among our median income populace? Not long either 

It’s like saying that John is a cripple because he can barely walk. John’s 13 month old

In fact, it’s like saying that again when John’s 18 month old and can now walk properly most of the time"
"Then keep thinking the old way and never change.

Good one
"In another thread someone cited the law. It's apparently true that the law states pedestrians have the right of way...
I didn't verify their source, I don't care that much.

But it's is entirely unfeasible given the road infrastructure.  So imagine if vehicles actually yielded right of way to any and every pedestrian crossing at a unsignalled crosswalk... Pure chaos."
"Well then as I already said, apparently not."
Yup
"The amount of deaths is irrelevant. Amount of deaths per 100,000 people is far more relevant.

Other small countries, even from the same general area (Cambodia was brought up as an example) do not have the same level of problems and selfishness on the road.

This unwillingness to acknowledge it may be part of the reason.

Road traffic accidents are the 5th most likely way you will die in Vietnam. There is a nearly 5% chance that it is how you will die. Not old age, stroke, heart disease. It's more likely to kill you than every form of cancer. Being hit by a car.

That can't be good dude. Clearly locals DON'T always manage to cross. And from what's being said, the drivers don't even respect red lights and tend to go on their phone. How can it EVER be truly safe."
[deleted]
That's fucking disgraceful. US police are out of control. :(
Where you from?  I’m sure no pedestrian has ever been killed by on coming traffic. Right?
"Who are you to say anything, are you Vietnamese?Whatever works for them is for them.  It’s like a dumb foreigner going to Japan and complain about raw fish restaurants everywhere.  LOL.  Entitle trash are everywhere I guess."
"I did not assume anything. I inferred your conservatism based on the opinions that you expressed. And to counter your newest argument: just because something is the same in Vietnam and some other countries, doesn’t mean it’s perfect and requires no improvements. For example, women are mistreated and objectified in Vietnam and many other countries, but that’s fine because when in fucking Rome?!

Do you even hear yourself? It’s amazing how you don’t see the conservatism (tính bảo thủ) in your thinking."
"Dude. I am Vietnamese and that is correct, people are rude as fuck on the street. Be thankful that these are being shared online, humility is needed to improve the country. Stop being so defensive, be more critisizing.

Secondly, yeah, 15-20 years in prison is like torture. We also have rehabilitation programs.

You are killing your own people by refusing to acknowledge road safety."
"That's why I'm not driving a bike (:

By giving in to them , you're just enabling them to break the law. Where you're from, there's law too right. Do you break the law in your home country ? Why are you breaking the law in Vietnam ? 

Why don't you do the same here? Just because everyone eats shit, does that mean you have to eat shit as well ? 

I'm not the one driving blindly here. The guy exiting a corner merging into the main road is the one driving blindly. If he's not driving blindly, he would have look to his left and see a car is approaching fast and he should have waited at the junction until its safe to exit the junction, no ? Or you're telling me that's not the right way to drive ?"

There's nothing to be celebrated about traffic in Hanoi especially, shit even compare Hanoi with HCMC and you see a stark difference.

You're welcome to be proud about sharing the road with these idiots (or be part of it yourself that's up to you) but to any remotely civilized person the writing is on the wall. Vietnam wont even save itself the fate it's heading which is Jakarta like traffic.

You ever been to Jakarta? im gonna assume not, it's bad. It's really bad and a city like Hanoi will be **worse**."
Your argument is based on your assumption that I'm conservative when that is far from the case. Bitching and moaning about traffic in Vietnam is like pissing in the wind. Adapt.
"From my point of view. These foreigners roll into Vietnam with their entitlement complaint about this and that. While Vietnam has great food, people, and rich history among many other things.  Traffic is part of the package. They act as if there’s no traffic fatalities in their country."

"Look I've said it a thousand times, just because rules are in place doesn't mean everyone is going to follow them, take your chances if you want but I'll approach driving like anyone could do anything at any time, because that is smart driving. By 'giving in to them' as you put it, I'm saving mine and their life, in the scheme of things what's more important? If it's the choice between breaking the law and being turned into mince meat, I'll break the law every time. 

That scenario though rarely occurs in my home country because people overwhelmingly follow the rules, we have cameras and police everywhere looking for it and the penalties are huge. So it would be stupid for me to switch to Vietnam mode in that scenario because I'm far more like to die. 

I never said it was the right way to drive, I said I think it's a smarter way to drive and that you have to be a good driver to survive, which is true.

If you think not adapting to your environment is smart... well, best of luck I hope it works out for you. I'll stick with my way."
"Signaled crosswalks are hardly the issue. Whether obeyed or not, at least there it makes sense that people don't walk on green and cats stop at red.  It's the unsignalled crosswalks that would be chaos."

Again. Are you Vietnamese? They do things their way and if you don’t like it. Peace!
"So they do not get the right of complaints? Do you only want to hear them shower Vietnamese people with empty praises and such?  
Having a problem is bad, but having a problem that foreigners complained about is VERY bad. We have to receive it with humility and try to help fixing the problem, instead of bashing people just to keep our own ego."
"Maybe you should stop being defensive because it's not a personal attack on you. Every country has room for improvement. It takes a level of self awareness and humility to understand where there are flaws so individuals can continue to strive to be better. It's something that vietnam lacks and all it says about you and your countrymen who share the same attitude as you is that you all want to remain a developing country while the likes of the countries around you develop faster because they are willing to improve. 

Your country wants to rapidly develop into an economic powerhouse but people like you make it unbelievably difficult for progress to be made. If you want economic growth, an increase in gdp and wages, and foreign investment to fast track Vietnam into the 21st century, you and the other nationalistic country men should ditch the attitude because there are a lot of areas that could dramatically improve. 

You bitch about foreigners but fail to understand that it's foreign investment, foreign demand, and tourism that drive a  large part of your economy. When foreign demand for manufacturing and tourism suffers, your economy is stagnant as it is now. When that happens, the only ones that suffer are the vietnamese people. Do you really want foreigners to leave and not come back? Well making it hostile and difficult for them to exist here is a good way to do it. However, if that happens, then they take their money with them. Just remember, for every tourist that sees posts like this and decides to go to Thailand instead of visiting here, that's money that isn't being spent here funding local businesses and circulating into your economy. Is that what you want?"
"No, it’s a logical error.

You’re trying to distract.  It’s a tool of those who can’t win an argument."
You're not too bright if you're unable to detect sarcasm 😉
"I definitely said all of those things, yes.

No I'm saying you should probably slow down, pedestrian or driver, but that seems to have upset you."
"You have no argument.

Instead of discussing Vietnam, you try and change the subject.

But compared to developed countries Vietnam’s auto fatality rate is pretty bad (adjusted for population and kms driven).

So there, VN is worse.  What’s next for you?"
aw baby cant handle any criticism of Vietnam at all whatsoever :(
C U Next Tuesday.
Thôi cãi gì nữa văn hoá giao thông nước mình như hạch. Bị chỉ trích tí là gào lên entitled foreigners 😂😂
"It works both ways. Foreigners can complain and I complain about their entitlements. 

It’s like hearing a foreigner complaining about Vietnamese “eat soup for breakfast” or “can’t believe they eat dogs in the north”. It’s part of Vietnamese culture and these foreigners are demonizing Vietnamese. Whatever problem Vietnam has it’s up to the Vietnamese to handle it and no need for foreign Karen’s to demand to see the manager.

Why are you catering to these foreigners? They come to Vietnam because their currency is stronger. Who give two shit about their opinions because we all know they don’t give two shit about Vietnamese opinion regarding their country."
"Most Foreign investments are from other Asian countries.

Tourism that spends the most is also from Asia.  OP is a typical entitle europoor from UK complaining about Vietnam’s society. 

Vietnam will improve whenever Vietnam wants to improve, don’t need no western Karen to yap their mouth."
I missed it too the first time. Nice zinger. May not transmit on REddit tho.  Hats off.

"OOO thank god. Glad you didn’t use your magic whataboutism card again!  

Vietnam has pho, great people, affordable hotel and rich history along with traffic. It’s part of the culture. Again who the hell are you demonize them. Are you from a country that pedestrians never get hit by traffic?"
'Farm Girl' is a biyatch. Don't pay that he/she no mind.
Awwww. The entitle foreigner wanting things their way and complains when they don’t get it!  I believe westerners label those people “karens”?  Hi Karen the manager is not here right now.  LOL
[deleted]
Except this is not a case of entitlement. OP is absolutely right.
"Nói đúng thì nhận mẹ đi liên quan gì ai nói. 

Also please tell me you’re Viet and cant take criticism, instead of a foreigner who wants to white knight. That is so much more pathetic"
"Ok, so what?"
"So you’re saying Vietnam’s culture is inextricably tied to running over pedestrians?   You’re saying Vietnamese culture would be loss if fewer people died?

That’s silly. 

And no, people are free to criticize it and I’m sure if you asked Vietnamese themselves they’d love it if fewer people died getting run over."
Tôi người Việt và tôi thấy giao thông Việt Nam bát nháo lôi thôi vl. Tôi đi các nước ĐNA khác và thấy giao thông người ta văn minh hơn mình
"WTG, just call her a biyatch. That totally supports your point."

"Sounds like you can save them from themselves, good job! You don't sound at all patronizing or insufferable."
Lol. Whatevs.
"You seem like the Karen here, that attitude slows down improvements."
"Right. You’re saying Vietnam is stuck back at the same stage as when the U.S. left after raping and murdering countless innocent Vietnamese? 

Singapore is too small to be a sample. S.Korea and Japan allow their country to be whores and be control by the U.S. to build military bases and a vessel/a puppet. 

Funny how you didn’t include other countries that’s been victims of western colonialism, countries in Africa. How are they doing compare to Vietnam?  Vietnam will raise on its own power."
[deleted]
[deleted]
"Well I have my own experience of walking in Vietnam, which was OP's original point, and what you and they are saying doesn't align with my experiences.  

You say I can't accept other views but you keep putting words in my mouth while also ignoring any of my questions. 

You admit you drive around getting angry at other drivers and I don't see Vietnamese people acting that way. So yes, you need to adapt to the ways of the country you are a foreigner in and not waste your energy thinking you can or should change things as an outsider."
"And your government don’t skimp off the top? Where you from, the states?  Do tell me how Nancy Pelosi has hundreds of million in her bank account from a government job that pays 100-200k a year."

"Now, There’s corruption everywhere? If your shit show of a country can grow with corruption, then so can Vietnam but clown show like you with baseless claims trying to demonize Vietnam is what makes you a racist little cry boy."

"Weren’t you teaching in Vietnam?  Talk about biting the hand that feeds you.  A true entitle western Karen.  

Your country is not corrupt? LOL. I’m guessing you’re from the states. If I’m wrong do correct me and I’ll pin point the dirt your country has.  

Yes, there’s a reason for rich countries. If you’re talking about western countries. It’s because they were murderous colonialist. white colonialist leeching dry everything from Africa.  Stealing and murdering all over Asia. That’s how they still rich by murdering and looting other countries, non white land."
[deleted]
"This has to be the dumbest statement. Look at all the countries in Africa. It’s been years since the European finally stop leeching off them. How come they are still 3rd world country? 

Vietnam still have villages and poor area but cities like HCMC and Hanoi shows a lot of growth. 

Typical of western Karen trying to down play the horrible shit their countries has done to others.  

As for Japan you do understand they are dogs to the U.S. military. Correct?  They are not allow to protect themsleves. Their economy was even fucked by corrupt westerners with the Plaza accord because they were growing too fast.  Don’t you know anything?  

Don’t you worry about Vietnam. It’s not your country but I do love how you leech off Vietnam and talk shit about Vietnam.  Typical western trash."
[deleted]
Look at this clown show worrying about a country that isn’t there. UK is a trash can since it cannot leech off other nations anymore. LOL keep thinking your shit hole of a country is better. Wonder why you’re in a Vietnam sub and not your own sub.  Couldn’t offered fish and chips back home?  LOL
[deleted]
LOL. But UK praise themselves as a 1st world country.  Imagine a 1st world country being so trash to compare itself to a developing country.  Again. Why the hell you in Vietnam leeching off them?  You’re one of those ungrateful Karen that talk shit about the hands that feeds you?   Typical euro trash.
[deleted]
"LOL. You’re working as an English teacher in Vietnam no?   If you dislike Vietnam so much. Peace!  Heard Mexico need Karen’s.  How about the Middle East.   

God I hope Vietnamese can see who you really are.  A entitle Piece of euro trash that belittle them while making a living off them."
[deleted]
That’s great to hear. So now you’re just taking advantage of Vietnamese cheap labor. Whenever you go back?  Do us all a favor and don’t come back. One less euro trash the better.
[deleted]
Hahaha. Maybe now but soon Vietnam will improve.  Hopefully you won’t be around to see it. Anyways. Peace euro trash Karen.
[deleted]
LOL it’s true and unfortunately We also accept trash from euro too. Sad I know.
"No, it isn't. It is a commonality shared between foreigners when crossing the road in Vietnam.

But you'll get used to it.

Some tips:

1. Try to cross the road where it has a zebra crossing and/or traffic lights. You should also make haste while you are crossing.
2. Make use of walking tunnels and pedestrian bridges as much as you could.
3. If you must cross a busy road where there aren't any utilities I mentioned, walk slowly and confidently. Wave your hand to indicate that you are trying to cross, don't make any sudden moves, keep walking at the same pace. Traffic participants will do their best to avoid hitting you.
4. If none of the above work, how's your insurance?"
Thailand traffic is way better than Vietnam.
There’s too many working traffic lights in Thailand. Too many u turns and I can’t honk every five seconds. I had to learn how to ride a scooter again. Do not recommend
Bro I am nearly 40  years old (male) and in my first day in VN I asked an elder Vietnamese man to help me and he literally hold my hand and we cross the road together lol.
"You just dont know the rules yet. saigon is a fascinating study for quirky driving rules. Once you learn it and master it you will love it and hate everything else.

bangkok is just gridlock."
"You and I are opposite my friend. 

I lived in both Thailand and have been in Vietnam for almost 6 years. 

In Thailand I: 
Got ran over by a motorbike driver and broke my rib. 
Got crashed into (from behind) but I got fined because I was an easy target (tho legally I didn't do anything wrong) 
Spent 30 minutes trying to cross a road because it was just impossible to cross, in the end someone drove me across the road. 

In Vietnam, people are professional dodgers. 
Crossing the road is very easy (just don't walk out rapidly in front of cars/limos/lorries) but motorbikes will let you pass. 

HN and HCMC are the worst for the roads but everyone else is okay."
"motorists are completely mental in viet nam, and exhibit far more reckless/selfish/dangerous behaviour than thailand. by a huge margin.

the infrastructure is severely underdeveloped, enforcement lax, and people generally do whatever they please. however, there's a method to the madness and lots of unwritten rules. after a few months you truly stop caring about your safety/sanity and somewhat get into the groove.

essentially, you need to constantly be scanning 360° and anticipate anyone can perform a random manoeuvre. you see highly illogical, and outright suicidal stuff on a daily basis. countless accidents, many of them fatal."
"Don't worry we play Cross the Road all the time  
And like in Cross the Road, the traffic lights don't have meanings"
Traffic lights are a suggestion in Vietnam and you will have to look both ways before you cross a one way street.
"Vietnam traffic is simple. 

1) Only worry about what is in front of you. If everyone does this, no problem. 

2) biggest vehicle has the right of way. 

3) when crossing street, just walk, look toward the oncoming traffic, and do not pause or change speed. Rule #1 will protect you."
Much higher percentage of motorbikes to cars in vietnam whereas in thailand theres a decent share of cars too. The swarms of motorbikes makes it more chaotic
"Thailand they drive alot faster than in VN but more people follow the rules of the road and are aware. I'd argue they drive too fast in Thailand. People can drive fast because people follow the rules. 

However in VN not enough people drive with awareness/ use their common sense. So people drive slower. Which I suppose in some ways is safer."
"They should just start to fine people that don't stop for pedestrians crossing, this behavior can't be acceptable."
Australian here that is used to very strict road laws. I was mind blown at the traffic in vietnam and how it all seems so reckless and chaotic. There's a method to the madness though and I can honestly say I found the majority of vietnamese drivers to be relatively safe and capable. The minority of bad drivers are really bad though. My worst experiences were on sleeper busses. Some are seriously insane the way they drive. Very entitled and careless. I don't have as much experience in Thailand but have experienced traffic in Bangkok and it wasn't nearly as bad as hcmc or hanoi
Thailand is years ahead. vN driving sucks steady posts on here abiut it
In Thailand four consecutive taxi drivers refused to take us to our location with no explanation whatsoever. We later found out that they didn't want to get stuck in traffic.
"Traffic in Hanoi is chaotic, especially in rush hour (I feel like it is slightly better in Da Nang or HCM City). It is a nightmare to move around if you don't own a personal vehicle and you still struggle a lot even when driving cars/motorbikes as no one cares about lanes and traffic light signals. The bus system is not efficient and it is challenging to obtain correct stops information, putting aside all the conflicts when several buses travel at the same time fighting for room with other vehicles in rush hour. Last but not least, we have finished only one route of public trains after over a decade of construction, which has barely solved much of the overview.

I just depressingly hope that we can manage to build a complete and functioning public transport system in the near future."
"I kind of like how traffic works in Vietnam. Its simple. You look 1m ahead of you. If there is nothing, then you keep driving."
An addition to #3 is don’t attempt to cross in front of a bus or truck. The large vehicles have right of way and will not accommodate you.
"To add to #3 ""sudden movements"": never go backward."
Thanks for the concrete answer! Just what I thought.
"Good to know, thanks!"
"> the infrastructure is severely underdeveloped, enforcement lax, and people generally do whatever they please. 

It's almost entirely down to driving behaviour and lack of enforcement. Even in places where the infrastructure is good, people drive the same reckless way or up onto the sidewalk if there's even a hint of waiting more than a few seconds."
"You forgot one thing…

in saigon it is permissible to drive a scooter the wrong way so long as you hug the curb like a pedestrian.

watch out for those"
You have to pause when someone in front of you coming or you get run over. I don't understand how it's possible.
Man the city buses in HCMC consider you target practice.
"Sigh can confirm. I honestly wonder why people here are so impatient in traffic, driving onto pavements / speeding immediately after green / cutting lanes saves you like what, a few seconds or a minute tops? Yet people do it all the time. I myself am guilty of this behavior but still curious."
"I’ve lived in HCMC for 7 years, and the roads have consistently gotten worse year on year. I think the issues can be broadly categorised into groups, but far and away the biggest issue is poor driving skills and/or ignorance of basic road safety. 

Yes, the road infrastructure isn’t perfect. And yes, the roads aren’t big enough for the amount of traffic. And yes, enforcement of traffic rules often focuses on trivial infringements like indicating and lane use. But, the driving. It’s terrible. It’s so very, very bad.

My commute to work is 2km which I make twice a day on pretty big, 3 lane roads in D3. Every single day, without fail, I can guarantee to see ALL of these major road violations in my short 5-10 minute journey to work.

1. Driving against the flow of traffic. This is so basic it blows my mind. It’s such an obvious no-no. Even on bridges, people put their own connivence above this most blatant Highway Code violation. 

2. Not getting in lane. People, especially cars, seem to think nothing of jumping the queue in the right hand lane of traffic, only to make a 90 degree left turn at the last minute. 

3. Merging without looking. Whether it’s joining a new road, or changing lanes at the last minute, people seem to rely more on their ears than their eyes. A simple glance before deviating from a straight line would be enough, but apparently it’s other road user’s responsibility to beep, not theirs to look. I don’t know if bad driving can get any worse when you literally have to say out loud - “look where you’re going”. 

4. Cars and bikes stopping in the right hand lane. One of the fundamental rules of a busy road is you maintain a consistent speed and don’t stop. Tell that to the car driver who decides to stop his 2 tonne SUV in the middle of the road during rush hour traffic because he fancies a banh mi for the rest of the drive home. 

These are just some of a multitude of bad driving habits that are completely normal on the roads here. It’s not to mention the phone use, general lack of awareness/attention, swerving, driving in tandem, the list goes on and on and on.

I love Vietnam and have made a happy home here. I have respect for the people and the country. I say this not to criticise or judge, but because I believe that a national conversation and confrontation about the driving habits is needed to help curve the thousands (of mainly under 18s) of completely unnecessary deaths and serious injuries experienced by road users every year."
"Because there is a massive lack of enforcement of the laws and the police are only out to get their little hand outs when people break the laws of the road. There’s no real consequences. Most people still don’t have an actual driving license, and the driving test Vietnamese have to take is laughable and you can bribe your way through it like every other aspect of Vietnamese life. Things are starting to get a little stricter, especially on drunk driving, but the biggest problem is enforcement and traffic police who are essentially just vultures."
"No. It will never change. I love and drive in Vietnam (HCMC) as well. The problem is that no one governs rules of the road and most people come from small villages where there are no rules. 
Someone said that Vietnam is basically a place where people tolerate the inconsideration, which is true. However, just like in China, people tend to have a “me first” mentality and don’t care about anyone else. No one turns their head, no one uses their mirror (even if they have one) and just expect others to give way to whatever that individual wants to do. 
Remember this is also still a second world country. People are more concerned with messaging and using their phones or smoking cigarettes. Anything to take away from focus of actual driving. Or doing things like trying to squeeze into tight fitting spaces between bikes/cars, or driving in sidewalks just because they want to. Because no one tells them they can’t. 
The biggest problem in this country is the lack of enforcement. When you have people who pick and choose when and how they want to work/enforce rules, there’s no consistency. I actually go over this with my older students. Learning about rules of the road and safety."
"Vietnamese rules of the road-

Turn on high beams and leave on forever. 

Signal lights on permanently or never on, you choose. 

Driving the wrong way around a roundabout is fine. 

Traffic lights mean nothing. 

Yeah it's fucked, I started giving people the finger who break the law and cause others to drive into danger to avoid them. They're gonna kill someone."
"No driving lessons or road safety standards, any idiot can get a car, and the worse the driver, the bigger the vehicle they tend to choose. No real law enforcement, just police officers chasing bribes. And of course a general culture of 'me me me, me first', lack of regard/value of the lives and wellbeing of others, and an unfortunate fatalism that pervades everything. Look at how they don't wear proper motorbike helmets, just the bare minimum to not get pulled over, but never enough to protect them.

24 preventable deaths on the road every day in Vietnam, and many times that number injured, often life changing injuries. 

And it gets worse, car drivers will often deliberately run someone over repeatedly after they hit them the first time, to kill them, so that they don't have to pay their hospital bills. It's utterly barbaric and it needs to be discussed more, brought out into the open, because authorities don't tend to do anything unless they are shamed into action."
"A very me first attitude, they drive for themselves not caring about anyone else. In most modern countries, for the most part, the population follows the rules making it safer for other driving and yourself at the same time. In vietnam no one has a concern on someone else's life and have no issue putting other people in harms way."
"Please. They did the covid thing because of fear and the govt forced them to, not because we’re some kind of higher moral being or careful people. In fact, while being extremely nice and friendly, we’re probably one of the most careless people in the world."
Every day I drive to work I think this exact thought at least a few dozen times.
"I was also wondering that

Take a look at this video: https://www.facebook.com/otosaigon/videos/832452881332491/

People are praising the driver for good skills and that he deserves to do it since he earned it (it's a Mercedes G63), like WTF

In the west, people would absolutely go nuts and go out of their cars to smack the shit out of him for reckless driving"
"Went vacationing in VN last year and I’ll never forget the poor woman on a motorcycle who got hit by a car. The bastard didn’t even stop driving. Luckily we were able to call emergency and she was fine, although she looked extremely out of it and there was so much blood. We were the only ones who stopped to help her first, everyone else just drove past her and I couldn’t believe it"
"My house is on a one-way road and people treat it like a normal two-way. I gotta dodge them like Mario Kart. Wish I can throw some turtle shells at them though. 

Good news: working my way to live in another country 🤣"
"For me it's the lack of safety, people here seem to drive like they're immortal."
"I'd say convenience sake. If society doesn't care, you wouldn't care either unless you really reflect and think about it. F.e. Vietnamese still throw their trash everywhere. Stopped counting how many rivers, lakes and bushes were full of trash bags and other human made materials killing the ecology. Many people think it's meaningless to act better, if everyone else doesn't change. That seems to be universal and can be found in other societies to. The only difference is just the spread of awareness. The Vietnamese government does very little to encourage a change."
"It's piss easy to get a driving license, plus no one reads the Traffic Law."
I feel like it's a very SE Asia thing where people don't have a sense of personal space. Everyone walks like they own the road. People would cross right in front of you. Yielding optional.
"The one that really pisses me off is people turning left but cutting onto the oncoming traffic side of the road instead of going forward an extra 3 meters before turning properly. They see me there and have the whole of their side of the turn completely empty, but still proceed to come onto my side, forcing both of us to a standstill or evasive maneuver.

I had a woman with 2 kids on the back (no helmets) almost wipe them all out one day due to this, and she seemed bemused when i shouted at her... lol"
"1. No enforcement of even the most basic rules, and 
2. (Regarding the ""no looking before merging/turning into traffic"") Vietnamese have been conditioned to only pay attention to what's happening directly in front of their eyes, and not around/behind them. Why this is I have no idea, but it seems to work okay. Which is why if you cross the road no matter how busy, traffic will tend to flow around you as you walk."
"Shitty road infrastructure, shitty road quality, shitty civil engineers, population density too high,  shitty road manners, complete disregard to bicycles, corrupted traffic cops"
"Imagine you are a toddler on a babybicycle driving around the playground , thats how the driving in Vietnam is."
"The thing that pisses me off the most is people pulling into traffic without looking or turning onto a street without looking. Today I watched a guy on his moped pull out right in front of a car, forcing the driver of the car to slam on his brakes. I'm from America, so I probably look crazy for checking my surroundings and mirrors before making a turn while most other people pull the ""good luck everybody else"" move.. yes exactly like in family guy."
I was walking on the side of the road. Some guy on his phone ran into me with his scooter. He was shocked lol
"Blame the gov. Imagine if we have someone like Lee Kuan Yew running this country. Vietnam is a golden land , but ran by a bunch of incompetent people"
"Many other comments have already covered what I wanted to write, but what I would like to add is unlike many countries, Vietnam is a motorbike-main country.

Motorbikes are way smaller, so they can move easier. That also allows them to ride onto sidewalks, into the oppositing direction of the other lane without causing problems, and just other annoying things. If they were driving cars, they would have had to abide with the laws since cars are significantly larger.

I feel like we are never turning into a car-main country though. The streets in large cities are too small, and residential houses and shops are only built with the motorbike culture in mind."
And then we have to cross this clusterfuck of traffic on foot.
"It rooted all the way to the driving test - where people used to pay 100-200k towards the supervisors so they can do all the tests for them. 

The ""sa hình"" (the test where you have to control the vehicle through various situations like entering the roundabout, emergency braking, parallel parking, etc) is filled with markings so you just need to memorize what to do when encounter those. 

The actual driving test on the actual road was just you accelerating and decelerating the vehicle according to the instructor on a 2km trip - all of which could be waived by paying the instructor 200k and he will literally write you the pass before you even start the vehicle."
"I think the main reason is that since they are poorer, they don't value their life as much."
"Because Vietnamese love breaking the laws and the government always go easy on them, the police getting jailed or sacked for beating or shooting at people driving recklessly is pretty common, I have even seen a lot of kids blaming the police for making them crash, claim that they would not cause accident if they were not chased."
"Lack of focus when taking driving classes, they only want to get through the driving test and don't give a single fuck about the laws or skills they're being taught. Lack of respect for the law, they always think they're better than everyone else, even the law so they just say fuck all and do whatever the fuck they want on the street.

And last but not least, police bribery. You do something wrong and the police pulls you over, give them some cash and you're good to go. They've been doing this shit for so long that when you ask a citizen what to do when you're given a ticket by the police, they literally have no clues because all they've ever done is paid on the spot then leave.

People here needs to understand the consequences when you don't comply with the law, the consequences when you don't know anything about driving (riding) but still make it out the street because you feel like to.

And one more thing, people here likes to talk about love, peace and unity when they fuck up beyond the point of helping or sympathize, which they show none when they feel like they still got the advantages in the situation. Responsibility is a lux here."
"I can’t count how many near death experiences I’ve had, been incredibly lucky. I live in DN and we’re at peak tourist season with massive buses veering at you in the opposite lane on the beach road, pedestrians are terrified to cross, and this year for the first time I saw my first fatality from the horrible driving here. If that’s not horrific enough, I know an 8 year old boy that lost his leg. 

Yet Đà Nẵng leaders just want to keep pumping unsustainable tourism and dumping sewage into the sea while doing little to improve quality of life for it’s citizens. 

Apologies for the rant, can’t do it on facebook for obvious reasons. I love VN and the people here are lovely (when not driving)."
"People literally don’t know how to drive; how many times have you seen a successful 3 point turn? How often have you seen some one drive with full beams on? How often does someone use warning lights as indicators?

Then there’s no incentive to learn any of these things, and several incentives to take about a loan and buy a massive car you don’t really need and can’t properly control"
"The biggest issue I have with this is Vietnamese people think you’re weird when you call it out. They don’t seem to acknowledge better driving will save lives and say things like, “it’ll never change”. 

WHO 2016 estimated that for every 100,000 people there are 26.4 killed in Vietnam motor accidents. Singapore was 2.7 Sweden was 2.8. Not saying we should think of matching rich countries, but there are some quick wins to be had with following basic international road rules. 

Sources: https://www.roadsafetyfacility.org/country/vietnam

I’ve been driving here for a year and seen a lot of terrible accidents. In Australia, they used to put the road toll on the news every night during summer holidays to put the fear into people. Perhaps if the police won’t enforce rules, we need something like this here to raise awareness."
"You forgot people eating corn on the cob while driving! Speaking of which, I need to get some corn."
"Because most driver driving with the mindset as fast as possible, they will trying to take the shortest route if they can, so running redl light, facetiming is usual thing, even taking opposite lane to they can overrun the driver ahead, etc......

Anyway, traffic in Vietnam, as shameful as it is, as a Vietnamese i admit, it like a battlefield"
"1. Driving education: If you ever take a driving license in Vietnam, the test is more like a technical test where it focuses on controlling the car technically. While the interaction with other vehicles is left untouched. So people tend to optimize to pass that shitty test.
2. Now, the test has dumped tens of millions of drivers out and it makes a total mess out there, even people with good intentions never have a chance to do good driving practices.
3."
"I live in the Netherlands for 7 years and drive car there for almost 3 years and when I first came back to Vietnam I instantly realized how bad the traffic is 😂😂 

Nobody respects the traffic rules (maybe only the traffic lights a bit), no whatsoever priority at any equal junctions, lane merging without checking rear/back mirrors and blind spots, watching/doing something else while driving… and the list goes on

I’ve lived in Vietnam for more than 23 years and had the thought “that’s what everyone does so who cares” so I guess the main problem is the attitude, people dont want to change anything but keep doing illegal stuffs anyway cause “that’s what everyone does” and the chance that you got caught by an traffic officer is relatively low so that also worsen the situation."
"What amazes me is how police don't try to take advantage of the situation. It would be an absolute gold mine ""fining"" people for basic traffic violations all over the place. Just wrong direction driving alone would generate a billion per month."
"Because most people are poor and unhappy with their lives. 

I hate it, too. But at this point, u gotta live with it. Unlikely to change anytime soon. 

The worst types of drivers are taxi cabs, tech-app bikers, vinjas, pick-up trucks, and cyclists."
"You’re crazy. 
I love driving in the wrong direction. 
Running red lights. 
Honking my horn every hour every second. 
I love not giving the right away. 
Vietnam driving is great!"
The way VN drive is a good reflection of how the people are.
"In general, many drivers in asian countries drive badly. They think they are very good at driving and it’s always other people bad at it. But in reality they themselves don’t follow basic driving rules that makes the traffic better."
"I visited some smaller towns and noticed the driving was much better than in years past.  I saw some nasty accidents back in the day, mostly caused by truck drivers running red lights.  Everyone was going fairly slowly, stopped at stop lights and used turn signals.  The police there have made an effort to stop aggressive riding.  As a foreigner I was so tempted to open up the gas, but did it sparingly.  I imagine it's harder to police in big cities where you have people still riding on the sidewalks."
"I don't get why you just can't say, I think you drive bad. There's always got to be these disclaimers. If you believe it's the truth say it. Someone will get upset no matter what you do or say. It's not your intent to offend them but rest assured talk to enough ppl someone will be upset. Be upfront and honest and if someone has a problem you talk it out honestly like adults. Then you know someones honest feelings . If you have a problem with them then ok you stay away from one another but I see this all the time."
"Bad? Define bad, I've been driving cars and now riding 500cc bike around Hanoi. I also rode my bike in Austrlia, drove in other countries. If you have been here for 7 years and still find traffic bad then you will be mad for the rest of your stay, ignore it, be safe yourself, give way, do what you think it's right on the road then you will feel good, for example, in Australia if I want to turn left or right I will have to drive past white line, turn on indicator, check the road to make sure is safe to turn. I do the same in Vietnam and get honks and verbal abuse all the time but at the end of the day I feel good because I behave on the road taking care of myself and others. I do the same thing on a motorcycle, not to the t like I would but i try my best to follow traffic rules whenever I can. Try it and see if it helps if not then we'll..."
Thailand has good motorbike traffic and is safer than vietnam but vietnam is much more efficient. Driving on the wrong direction? You save over two minutes saving time crime driving pass your location and waiting for the light to make the u turn. I love how I’m vietnam you can make a uturn in the middle of traffic. Love how you can pull up in the scooter and everything is a drive thru. Don’t even get me started on phone use and driving. How else are these grab guys suppose to pick people up and do deliveries without their phones?
"As a viet kieu born in germany, I prolly experienced the most opposite traffic. That's why I do really love vietnamese driving and traffic. 
To me vietnamese people are driving very aware since everything is so chaotic, everybody is totally focusing on what's happening in front of them. Since you don't really have everything insurance covered, I think that in vn you actually drive more careful. 
You also honk to warn and you always evaluate the situation, like if there's not much traffic, would it be actually dangerous to cross the red lights? Ofc not.
So for a vietnamese it would be just dumb to waste time there.

And in Germany there's rules for everything and everyone abides them without further thinking. Which makes driving fast very safe, but since ppl are relying so much on the rules and insurance, you drive around very mindlessly. That's why they dont react well to freak accidents and on top of that they have so much ego here, like if you honk at someone here, they will actually sabotage the traffic because they feel so attacked by that. It's insane and very selfish.

Last year 2.8K died in Germany and in Vietnam it was 6.4k due to traffic accidents. And if you regard the chaos,  that you have a bigger population and density in Vietnam and that death rates on the motorcycle is way higher compared to cars. I really believe that vietnamese driving is actually more efficient and safer, even tho it's deceptive at first."
"Btw, out of countries that have reps for bad driving it isn't actually that bad hahaha. I have lived in places with muchhhhhhhhhhh worse lol"
Have you ever been to the Driving Center where you take the License test? Or have you ever taken the test yourself?
"Hear me out, just get a high cc motorcycle. One with a aftermarket exhaust on it that’s just loud enough to be heard but not overbearing (one with a Cat on it preferably so it’s still within the DB law limits). 

I rode on a SH300i for 1 year and have gotten into 6 accidents that was the fault of the other party. I switched to a CB650R and 0 accidents in 2 years of riding daily. Literally everyone on the road hears me coming and gets out of the way or don’t want to be anywhere near me."
I’ve seen all the things you mentioned in the US
"You must have only been to Vietnam to make such stupid generalizations about their driving. Go to similar countries and it's even worse. Let the people do what they want with their own country; it works for them until they want to change it. All I know is that after living there for 15 years,  Vietnam has made me a better driver. I'm now more patient, don't use my horns unless absolutely necessary, and don't get upset at people cutting me off. Stop acting like you live in some kind of perfect country. The U.S now has over 400 mass shootings and I live in it. I don't go around telling people what they can do with their guns. Fuck off."
feel free to move to another country
"Honestly I couldn’t agree with you more… in the United States where I’m from LA the worst city to drive through is Garden Grove … that is like VIETNAMESE TERRITORY OVER THERE, and everytime I go there I always get hit in the back.  No joke"
because i thinks vietnamese is so bad everyone always driver after drank alcohol
"No man , i thing they r so fkin good because they can survive on Hanoi's street"
"Bad driving isn't unique to big cities in VN, but in cities it's really the worst. 

I moved to HCMC for uni and work 6 years ago and honestly traffic is one of the dealbreaker for me when it comes to living here, I'm just here because my job pays well and I'm always thinking about getting the f out of here.

Where I'm from, which is the countryside of Mekong delta, it's very hard to find people running red lights and going opposite direction. Here in HCMC I see it e-ve-ry day, traffic is horrible, 4km commute sometimes takes 30 minutes!

The problem is very frustrating because we have built such a walkable city, with small streets branching at intersections every hundred meters or so, lack of planning with regard to building use has unexpectedly fostered excellent mixed use infrastructures,  but due to people taking over the sidewalks, traffic being dangerous and chaotic, underdeveloped public transit and now the emerging car culture which is only making everything worse.

I think it's easy to blame people but I believe this is ultimately due to lack of regulation of personal vehicles and under-developing public transit. No amount of self awareness and good driving skills can make traffic in HCMC bearable, with the way we built the city, the increasing number of people living here along with their personal vehicles."
"as a Viet person, i think the reason is its too easy to get driver license especially motorbike driver license🤭
in Ha Noi and Ho Chi Minh, population is really high,  the infrastructure is not good enough to responsive, roads are small but a lot of vehicles, everyone wanna go faster then…😝"
"When I was small my mom used to drive me to school, and I would sit behind, eating Banh Mi. Is it ok?"
They literally honk and pass when the visibility is minimum. A mystery.
If u dont know VietNam its very ...🤣🤣
"I feel like this is the case for almost everyone driving something on 2 wheels. In Europe the people on the road that drive the most dangerously are cyclists and people on scooters. 

Isn’t Italy’s scooter culture quite similar to Vietnam in certain ways 😂"
"It can change. I think many people forget that the most basic thing is currently still missing.
MOST of the people on the road don’t hold a drivers license.
That is the BIG difference to first world countries  in which literally EVERY person must hold one. Therefor nobody taught them about risks nor safety. They just aren’t aware. How could they be? 

The next thing to look at would be, that the people holding a drivers license in VN didn’t receive proper training.

Step by step.

It will take some time but I am sure, that the day will come when Vietnam has developed enough and a drivers license is the basic requirement for everyone. That alone will make a huge change."
"Honestly, it's a lot better than another nearby asian country that china wants to take over."
Tại vì luật pháp có những chế tài không đủ mạnh. Và người dân chưa bị ảnh hưởng kinh tế. Thử đè ra phạt nặng xem. À mà do tiêu cực nữa :)) mấy anh áo vàng ăn quá 🥴
You should see how they drive in Orange County.. some drive like they’re still in Vietnam but in cars 😬😱
The illusion of immortality...
"Grab motorcycle drivers here are very much ignorant, I call for motorcycles a lot here. Although some of them don’t run red lights, most of them do. They really just want to save time and get the cash. I don’t blame them tho, living is hard when you don’t even have enough money to pay for food. Obviously it’s wrong and it’s not only grab drivers, it’s also the people. A lot of people here tend to not care about the traffic at all because most of the time, they don’t get themselves in accidents. The amount of accidents and death are pretty little compare to the amount of times and people that have broken the law. People are just so ignorant here, they’ll blame “fate” when tragedies happens."
"When in Rome, do as the Romans do..."
"I don't think it's a driving skill problem. People here drive as good and bad as any other country. 

From my point of view and experience it's a problem of mindset/education. People here drive and live like they are alone, they have all rights and own anything. As my wife reminds me all the time concept like respecting each other or caring about other doesn't exist here. 

And about Covid, if you really think the reaction of people was some sort of unity to protect everyone, you are really naive, people were scared for themself, nothing more."
Vietnamese still have the war trauma in their minds. Driving tells a lot about psychology of the driver.
You think eating banh mi while driving is easy? It takes some serious skills and fucked up mindsets to do so
"Driving a car here is even worse. I have to deal with all the things you mentioned on top of having to worry about hitting and killing these people. I can't count the times I have had to slam on my brakes to save some stupid person's life who has blindly drifted into my lane without looking. 

The speed drivers go is another issue. In a motoebike, you can navigate around the oblivious assholes going 20 kmph under the speed limit. In a car, you are forced to waste your time being stuck behind them or drive aggressively to get around them, which puts other people at risk. 

The lack of hustle most drivers have to pointlessly go far under the speed limit just highlights that the vast majority of people here have no business driving a motorbike. I think the metro will help this issue a lot, as will the plan to phase out motorbikes altogether in Hanoi and Saigon."
What I don't understand is why baby car seats are not more common if people drive so bad. Wonder if it's because accidents involve babies are not common enough?
"One possible reason: this is a culture without The Golden Rule. Also, people have grown up with no enforcement of traffic laws, except for helmets and turn indicators on motorbikes, I don’t know what gets cars pulled over. 

I just spent a week in “poor left-behind” Cambodia and was shocked: courteous drivers, not in a selfish panic, never driving the wrong way, never running lights. Like Thailand. (But speeding & passing by suicidal buses & vans a problem on all SEAsia highways)."
nah its just Monday in Hanoi 🤣🤣
I hope VN gvmn will install cameras all over roads and start bill drivers for violated rules (bikes and cars). I see only this method can work here
Massive lack of common sense and just a total disregard for others.
I will keep it short and simple. The traffic here is absolutely fucked and beyond save!
"Until I came to Vietnam, I'd never seen seen (seemingly) dead bodies on the road so frequently. 

I'd have thought seeing people die, or at least seeing dead bodies on the road would be eough to get people to think critically and change... but...."
Because we are monkeys. We do not act like human.
I drive/ride like the next mofos is gunna have a spontaneous outburst of suicidal/murderous fit every other 5 mins. People are either ignorant or just... uneducated. The theoretical portion of the bike license can be bypassed with like a few hunnid dong (at least when i got it in 2015...
"Because they drive the exact same way they live their lives: no planning ahead and no consideration/awareness of others. I swear most Viets think they are the only person on the road.

They've also grown up watching their parents and everyone in their world drive the same way, so it is totally normal to them."
"People here dont care abt shit, when shit happens they just take it as it is and avoid it themselves rather than finding ways to improve the 💩"
"It's ok to criticise though, and that's indeed what you are doing. Don't be ashamed of thinking critically and voicing it, Vietnam needs a lot more of that. You don't improve things by not criticising."
"> Merging without looking. Whether it’s joining a new road, or changing lanes at the last minute, people seem to rely more on their ears than their eyes. A simple glance before deviating from a straight line would be enough, but apparently it’s other road user’s responsibility to beep, not theirs to look. I don’t know if bad driving can get any worse when you literally have to say out loud - “look where you’re going”. 

This one always confuses me, you'd think it would be a basic survival reflex to look in the direction tons of moving vehicles are approaching from."
This is how Miami is quickly becoming
"yeah, electric bike and motorbike with certain cubic meters doesn't require you to have a license."
"The driving test my wife took in Vietnam was way more comprehensive and harder than what I took in NYC. And NYC road tests are probably on the harder side in the US due to the number of cars on the road at any time and the need to parallel park in a congested city.

The cracking down on Vietnamese driving schools being lenient has been in the news recently too."
"Hey, I am Vietnamese, I use the rear mirror when driving from the day I learned how to drive.  There are some people use it. Just want to say that. 🤣"
"Yeah what I noticed is sometimes motorcyclists drive on the wrong side of the road, on the motorcycle Lane if they want to turn left. Instead of doing a u-turn"
I prefer the term suffering in silence.
"I do not think I can suscribe to that. 

As many bad people on the street, there are plenty good people too. I drive a car and more often than not being patient makes the drivers around me be patient too?

Then again, I learned driving in another country so my style is very defensive. I found that ""real"" vietnamese drivers tend to be even more defensive and save than I am tho. No idea if it is specific to the driving service I book when I book one"
But in their eyes you’re being outrageously rude lol
I believe there is only one rule : get out of the way (only) of vehicles bigger than you
"Other rule: 
Ninja lead / vision has the right to ride and turn infront of car or stop suddenly in the middle of the road to do something. 

 Vehicles in the back keep pressing the horn, and you have to move your vehicle even if it is crowded in traffic jam."
"It's like in other countries the roads are a designated transportation system for cars, bikes and trucks. In Vietnam, anywhere outside of a building is just available space, not designed for any particular use it's free game to put your car, bike or truck."
"Yeah, but in Vietnam, irresponsible driving is so widespread and prevalent, and looking at how aggressive irresponsible drivers would confront other law-abiding drivers caught on cam viral on social media, I'm starting to wonder if it's an issue with Vietnam's standard and rigour of tests for issuance of driver's license. It seems like as though the irresponsible drivers sincerely think they are right and completely oblivious of the road rules."
"Tbh the Covid thing the gov did really well because they know they cant make the people's attitude suddenly have a 180 so they utilized that attitude to enforce laws. Thats more brilliant than most people think.

If only they do the same with traffic laws tho"
"This is what I mean… it’s not just poor people.

And Vietnamese just find it funny, could of killed some body but didn’t so it’s a funny joke. 🫣🫣"
There will be a congestion further up and the driver earned 0 seconds by doing that reckless maneuver and probably burnt 300% more gas.
"Yeah with that centre of gravity, too fast around a corner or someone taps his car in the sweet spot and that car will be lying on it’s side. Also poor use of the indicator as well."
Unfortunately this is common :/
"Next time, record, say it clearly that you help someone before you help."
"My house is also on a one way road and it's near two school so at 5:pm the place is crowded, and because most kids who goes there live in the market which would require you to go in the opposite direction the road if you want to go home under 5 minutes, one guy have the audacity to ask why am i going the opposite direction of traffic when i was blocked by another guy, but thankfully i have only have to go home around that time for a short period of time.

Also the street a bit further ahead is a two way road, but at rush hours that place become a one way road, you want to go straight to your house instead having to make an extremely long turn that will most certainly trap you in a another traffic jam? No fuck you."
"It definitely is.  I live (and drive) in Malaysia and people here have many of the same habits and lack of awareness.  Heck, my only accident here was a woman who backed into me because she didn’t look behind her before throwing her car into reverse 🤦‍♀️.  Thankfully I have a dash cam and could prove I didn’t rear end her when she tried to claim that.  Driving in Vietnam is far worse than Malaysia, but same mentality."
Vietnam is poorer and just has a lot of corruption. No incentive to properly enforce the laws if the police can just be bribed. Same in Cambodia and Thailand
They are making people drive like idiots?
"that's honestly untrue, cars, buses or trucks drive like a motorbike. They zig zag, pass swarms of bikes on the opposite lane in city centers, cut right in front of you, jump red lights etc. and nothing at all happens to them"
"The car drivers are by far the worst, most selfish, mindless, and most dangerous in Vietnam. Then of course you have the trucks and buses..."
"Bro, couple of moths ago i saw a bus taking over another bus that is already on the edge of the lane by going over to the other lane, the road is a two way road with two lane btw. And the other lane wasn't crowded but it was far from empty."
"""police getting jailed or sacked for beating or shooting at people driving recklessly"" so not shooting and beating people for recklessly driving is going easy on them?"
"You do know that you don't stop reckless drivers with beatings or gunfire, right?

There are other consequences for broken laws which can be used."
"Yeah, you tell the truth. It's very hard to be a policeman in Vietnam. A lot of people don't care about the laws or the rules. Someone even assaults the police. Such a terrible thing in my country."
"Lol what, can you show me some sources where police shot at people for driving recklessly? I’ve lived here most of my life and never heard such a case, never mind it being “pretty common”."
"I’m also living in Đà Nẵng, I know what you mean on the beach road… it’s constant taxis or bus’s pulling in and out 😅"
don’t forget to drive on the wrong side of the road with your signal light left on while you eat that corn 🌽 😂
"more like giving bribes to the inspectors and remembering hints on those sa hình test, it's just so disappointing we put hell lot of money into this yet are still taught to not take driving seriously"
"lol the worst are the lower earning classes of people ? Sorry but you haven’t a clue .

Taxis can be broken intro three groups . The ones who should never be near a car , the grabs who are hit and miss and the old school taxi guys who do actually know how to drive . 

The worst culprits are middle and upper middle class Vietnamese who just bought the car . They are moronic . Truck drivers , what do you except ? They are paid nothing and if they don’t make it on time then they don’t get paid not to mention drug use and whatnot . 

It has nothing to do with being poor . It’s plain and simple ignorance and has only gotten worse in the time I’ve been here which is more than 10 years . 

Phone usage whilst driving must be in the top 5 in the world . Ask yourself why you never see queues here or people waiting their turn then see what happens when you put them behind a wheel . 

Hanoi is worse for it compared to other large cities ."
Lol some of the worst driving I’ve ever seen in Vietnam has been from rich assholes in SUVs
You mean everyone 😂
"""most people""??? I don't think so, bro.  
Hoặc là những người xung quanh bạn thế chứ quanh tôi có thể m.n không giàu cơ mà luôn cố kiếm tiền và cải thiện cuộc sống. Đấy là chưa kể n chả liên quan gì mấy đến văn hóa giao thông, người giàu vẫn lái xe tệ mà."
Socioeconomic status is not relevant in this case. It's more about the quality and rigour of driving test for driver's license.
"I don’t think this is true because most people are very nice, friendly and wouldn’t hurt a fly. Put them behind the wheels and it becomes the opposite."
I agree for the most time I try to ignore it and I try not to get angry but I saw a grandma get smashed by truck the other day and honestly it was hard to ignore. 😟
"With headphones/EarPod, far safer than driving one handed and staring at a screen they can’t see in the sun. I’m aware of the law against audio devices, and it should be changed."
">I rode on a SH300i for 1 year and have gotten into 6 accidents that was the fault of the other party.

Oof. Did they compensate you or they argued with you? And did you benefit from insurance coverage?

>I switched to a CB650R and 0 accidents in 2 years of riding daily. Literally everyone on the road hears me coming and gets out of the way or don’t want to be anywhere near me.

Nice trick. Will keep this in mind, hehe. Thanks for sharing!"
Hm maybe so but I remember when I first visited the US and got screamed at by a lady for “J walking”… even though she was 10 meters away. Different attitude.
"Wow someone’s grumpy, I’m not from the US but I guess that’s a fair comparison. (I also feel guns should be banned worldwide.)

It’s not a generalization, it’s a statistic. the death rate in Vietnam due to roadside accidents is very high. I literally said “I mean no offense.” I saw a grandma get smashed by a truck yesterday and was thinking can Vietnamese driving improve so less Vietnamese die to a meaningless death each year."
Yeah if the Viets could actually take criticism to begin with. Yikes
"I think that is true. But to fix the problem it’s a matter of resources and enforcement.  

There was a time in vietnam where nobody wore helmets and ignored helmet laws. Then the officials really cracked down and now for the most part everyone abides and wears one. 

Most people who ignore the traffic laws do it because they can and because everyone else is doing it. 

With heavy enforcement a lot less people will do it. And the people who do it because everyone else is will also stop. In the end there will be just the minority of assholes that don’t care and will violate the rules. Just like everywhere else. 

Enforcement enforcement enforcement. Criticism is meaningless and won’t work not because of Vietnamese people but because that’s just how human nature works."
"Nah, how about we just blindly cut across multiple lanes of opposing traffic without dropping a single km/h."
"Oh right, I get downvoted for having actual experience in both places...some really open minded people here."
The driving test I took in Vietnam could hardly have been called a driving test. A bike handling test is not a driving test.
"Not sometimes. They do it whenever they feel like cause they are too lazy and lack patience to have to cross over. This is just normal, especially with sone many coming from villages and smaller cities. Most people in HCMC aren’t from HCMC"
That’s a way you could describe it
"I also learned driving in another country (not Vietnam). I’m from the New York area and a very offensive driver. I don’t sit and wait for things to happen before reacting. I’m a proactive person and try to anticipate the dumb things people do by not paying attention.  Like today, one person (in typical fashion) doesn’t look where they are going and just want to drift through the lane with no care or concern for anyone, doesn’t look if it’s clear to move through the lane, almost crashing right into me. And of course no one cares. The inconsideration is that they just expect people to move out of their way. Which is absolutely not safe. But safety isn’t actually a concern or else people would out helmets on their kids too, not letting them just stand in the bikes, not riding with 4 people on a bike.  Just because it’s the social norm, it’s still not safe and definitely not working rules/laws of the road."
Especially if they are older than the person they hit.
"Yes, it's also the middle class, the rich and the ultra rich. Everybody drives like shit and tries to bury at least a body per day, it's so frustrating

The nice thing though is how foreigners drive their cars with a good driving etiquette (by yielding, by driving on the right when going slow and using the left lane to pass, by thanking when someone else yielded for us when merging, etc.), I myself drive a car too and I hope the more we are the better example we can give and gradually change the vietnamese's driving mentality"
Exactly
"It's not really the incompetency, but Lack of enforcement due to corruption.  In less corrupt countries, asshole drivers will eventually either A) stop being an asshole due to excessive fines, or B) lose their driver license due to points.  Most of Vn's problems are due to that same reason."
"Not to mention those inglorious ""Limousine"""
"Yeah, people expect the police to stand still and do nothing with the reckless drivers, the government kinda agree with that."
"I saw the news on Dan Tri 3-4 years ago, a Facebook page even posted it. I currently can't find it but I remember it was a rubber gun."
"The reason why I said ""poor"" is because it's tangential to being ignorant. Most poor people who participate in traffic nowadays always need to hit a quota for their whatever jobs. And like you said, paid almost nothing if they don't make it on time. They're too poor to care about not being ignorant. There's always someone who could take their portions if they don't take it fast enough.

Of course, people with money can be lousy in traffic, too. But drive around the city and see which bugs you more, cars or broke people on motorbikes."
"""some"". what about *most*?"
That's not wrong
"It is relevant actually. Take a 15min trip around the city and see how many tech-app motorbike riders, what % of them riding around twiddling on their phones. Tell me those riders are middle/upper class. And that’s just tech-app motorbike riders. To them, driving isn’t a chore but a job, which has quota, which need to be “time efficient” by ignoring the safety of others. Simply looking at your phone while driving is dangerous. See for yourself how many people in traffic with self-made cargos, vending carts, overloading, etc. participating in traffic and tell me they’re not poor and not affecting traffic negatively."
"It’s very true if you just wanna be racist and find away to generalize the worst aspect of daily life in a place and attribute it to the whole people. 
“The way these people do this one thing tells you that they are no better than animals” that’s what the comment before you tried to do."
"Any time there are on a road  footpath or in a line it's a free for all, once they sit down they are completely opposite."
"Well she's probably in a better place right now, sorry you had to see it. I normally try to get past accident scene as quick as I can. Oh and get a proper HJC helmet, I never get on my bike without proper helmet"
"No insurance for me since I imported the scooter from Italy. Also most of them argued until I point out the Go Pro cam strapped the side of my full face helmet. I never leave the house without it for situations like this.

Also for compensation, all the people that hit me was from the working class and could not afford it. So I always had to be the one to fork out my own money to repair the bike."
"What I'm trying to get through to you is that every country has their own problems. There's no need to make comparison, especially when you haven't been to a lot of countries. Vietnam doesn't even make the top 20 for traffic deaths in the world. It's like complaining about trash. There isn't one country in this world that doesn't have a trash problem before and after going through the industrial revolution. Just stop complaining and try to improve what's deficient in your own country. Point out something positive about your experience in someone else's country."
"They are going to have to learn to whether they like it or not, quite frankly."
"Nothing changes anywhere in the world because of criticism. It has nothing to do with Vietnamese people. It has to do with enforcement of the laws. 

If you go to australia or USA you will notice everyone exceeds the speed limit.  They always go to 10-20kmph over because no one enforced it at that level. Then everyone else does it because they see everyone speeding too. As a result nearly everyone is speeding. 

Same behavior in vietnam. No enforcement, then everyone seeing everyone breaking the rules and copying."
So why isn't there more enforcement if most people there seem to criticism this behavior so much? Why doesn't the public support more government efforts to enhance road safety?
"It is the mindset and education. They do not care about things, they only think if it is convenience for them or not. For example, one time, my mom forced me to ride wrong way in 1 way road because it is fastest way to go rather than take 30 mins to go around."
"To be fair though, driving slowly backwards is actually much safer than having to cross traffic twice"
"That isn't what I mean with defensively driving, sorry might be a wrong translation but I mean as a wait and see kind of driving style but also be reactive that I and  anticipate ppl being stupid.

Like I don't overtake trucks, I let bikes go first because idk, not in a hurry."
"Not really. Traffic policemen and Mobile Police can use excessive forces (not more than necessary) if you don't obey their orders/signals to stop your vehicles.   
Of course they can't shoot you without probable cause thou."
Sounds like a mischaracterization to call it a pretty common occurrence then.
"Cars , by a long mile . Seeing so many every day that can’t tolerate 10 seconds of a red light so they literally “swing” the car over to the right line just to save some time and wreck the supposed motorcycle lane . Sad and pathetic ."
">Simply looking at your phone while driving is dangerous.

^(In Vietnam this is not a serious problem because it's just impractical to pull this off while riding a motorbike, except ride-hailing motorbike drivers who have the phone mounted on their bike but even so they do it because they need to check the map and it's typically for a short while only. It's possible to avoid this small group of inattentive people. The serious problem in Vietnam is dangerous manoeuvrings, which is difficult to avoid and are usually deliberately done while being attentive.)

>To them, driving isn’t a chore but a job, which has quota, which need to be “time efficient” by ignoring the safety of others.

Sorry, I don't buy this excuse. Whether it's a chore or a job, *time efficiency* matters to everybody as well. For example, one has a business meeting and need to arrive at specific timing, even though the act of driving is not a job for that person, but time matters to that person and it directly affects income as well. The idea that *time efficiency* only matters to people who monetize driving because it impacts their income is severely flawed. *Time efficiency* may also affect the income of people whose jobs are not related to driving."
">Also for compensation, all the people that hit me was from the working class and could not afford it. So I always had to be the one to fork out my own money to repair the bike.

You are too generous. This is merely my personal opinion and there is no right or wrong even if I opine about its rightness:

>Also most of them argued until I point out the Go Pro cam……

I think you are wrong to let unrepentant wrongdoers off just because they are poor working class. There is a difference between being magnanimous to financially disadvantaged, remorseful perpetrators and being permissive to dishonest perpetrators who attempt to lie their way out of accountability for their actions.

If I know I'm in the right and they are definitely in the wrong, I wouldn't reveal my cam in advance, I would test the character of the person first by watching how they respond to their mistakes and make a decision on what's next based on their honesty and penitence. In my world, forgiveness is determined by honesty, admission of guilt and remorse, not socioeconomic status.

By not punishing dishonest and manipulative people, you are sending them a wrong message and they will likely continue to use lies as a way to avoid consequence in the future."
"Australia has speed cameras everywhere, they made over a billion dollars in 2016/17 financial year. Strangely enough, speed less now :)

Lol anyone trying to compare North American traffic to Vietnam is a moron. The speed limit is mostly irrelevant to safety. The danger is people going vastly different speeds.
"Like everything it’s priorities and costs. You can look at things like building the metro as ways to help reduce the problem. 

Also how much criticism is there really?  A vocal minority on an English speaking forum that’s probably mostly expats doesn’t necessarily mean the majority of Vietnamese view solving traffic violations as something the govt should prioritize."
"Yes. That’s true. But not logical, which happens a lot (lack of logic) because things here just aren’t to the standard of much of the rest of the world. Like getting random made up answers when people don’t know answers to questions. Then expected to just accept. I do enjoy it here, but wouldn’t call it home."
"yeh, MHPTKTHD version was like beating them while they are already caught/on the ground, being able to use force to make them stop the current gangrenous actions makes more sense. I can't imagine many country allows shooting a car chase"

"did you just seriously say that looking at your phone while driving in Vietnam isn’t a serious problem? really? 
Time efficiency is very different from Time Management. If you have a meeting you have to be at at 8Am, and you know it’d typically take you 30 mins to drive there, you can plan to leave at 7:15AM to be safe. Arriving at 7:45 isn’t much of a waste of your time. 
But as a shipper for example, you do 100 deliveries a day to earn X amount of money. With your earning depends on the amount of deliveries you make, increasing deliveries per day is the way to go. But how can you make more deliveries? by making each delivery faster. And how do you do that? by driving faster and ignoring safety."
"I mean it’s an analogue. Not a direct comparison. Regardless speed is the literally the biggest factor in likelihood of death or serious injury in an accident. A difference of 10kmph can literally more than double the likelihood of death.  It also reduces the amount of time you have to react as well. 

So to say speeding is irrelevant to safety is just dumb. The majority of traffic deaths in the USA and Australia involve speeding.

">Also how much criticism is there really?

Millions of Viets suffer road rage daily due to their fellow citizens."
Yeah most Vietnamese honestly believe their driving style is optimal.
"It is rational and logical to minimize the harm that could happen to you or others by crossing oncoming traffic. It's just not legal. But especially in Vietnam the government has a lot of stupid rules so people are used to having to evaluate legality in light of whether it's reasonable or not. People here, as in every foreign country, have different ideas than you, you shouldn't be expected to call it home if you can't adapt. As a foreigner, you aren't nearly exposed to the absolute shitshow of bureaucracy that leaves many Vietnamese skeptical of rules in general."
\*eagles cawing in the background\*
"Yes I agree they are no angels BUT cars don’t help the situation . If there were only cars on the road it would be a mess like KL with gridlock and traffic not moving for hours . If it was just bikes things would work but that’s not reality and we aren’t going in that direction . Instead we are going for the impression that we are progressing and developing with cars and public transport but that’s far from the truth . More innocent people will have to die before things get better , that’s the truth unfortunately ."
">did you just seriously say that looking at your phone while driving in Vietnam isn’t a serious problem? really?

It isn't a serious problem because it isn't as prevalent as countries with car-dominant traffic. Most vehicles in Vietnam are motorcycles, it's difficult to be inattentive by using phone while riding a motorbike. The car drivers are also less inclined to be inattentive on the roads because motorbike riders frequently engage in dangerous manoeuvrings. Thus, the distraction due to using of phone is typically short lived.

>With your earning depends on the amount of deliveries you make, increasing deliveries per day is the way to go. But how can you make more deliveries? by making each delivery faster. And how do you do that? by driving faster and ignoring safety.

**It is wrong to increase one's income by neglecting road safety.** There is a physical limitation on how many deliveries you can do a day depending on many variables, and one have to accept the inherent limitations when making money that way. Time efficiency shouldn't be an excuse for decision-making on job selection. If the job is not paying well, then that's the financial limitation of the job.

**Edit:** Time efficiency affects everyone, including people who are not directly making money off driving. The amount of time spent on road affects the total number of hours one can work in a day, including white-collar workers. The idea that somehow *time efficiency* is only relevant for poor/lower-middle-class drivers and thus justify or excuse their dangerous driving is wrong and should not be accepted."
"Mostly just the traffic and lack of rules, well, rules that are unwritten and aren’t the safest. That’s my biggest crossing traffic is normal. In every country. Or “jug handles” that take you around to the right. Those make logical sense. What happens here is pure laziness. Plain and simple. People don’t want to do any more than they feel they want to. Just like with fixing things. Things here are “fixed” with a bandaid to just continue needing fixing, rather than properly sorting something the first time, only care about paying as little as possible. 
Education is the biggest thing that needs to change here."
"That’s true. But there’s tons of things in America that make no sense now either lol. But on a common sense level, that’s the thing that needs to change most. And the consideration for other people."
"I really dont understand why you are trying to opine.  
One act of looking at your phone while driving/riding, alone, is dangerous, which means it can potentially cause accidents by being inattentive. Reckless manoeuvrings are also dangerous, and inherently, it can potentially cause more lethal accidents. But the degree of lethality of the accidents shouldn't determine whether the action is a serious problem. Whether you're being inattentive for 15 seconds or 15 hours don't really make a difference in the case of itself being a dangerous problem. Traffic accidents happen in split instances, being inattentive for even 5 seconds is already potentially dangerous.

I dont know what you're trying to argue for about ""time efficient"" for low-income people partake in low-paying jobs that requires them to be in traffic. It is what it is. Most of these people cannot get a different job because of the economy. It's not like you can tell them ""Hey go get a job as a security guard or a parking attendent"". Low-income people don't have much option when it comes to jobs. And with company like Vins or VinaSun, Grab, Gojek, etc keep pushing their recruitment programs to hire more drivers/riders, you will see more people participate in this type of job."
">Whether you're being inattentive for 15 seconds or 15 hours don't really make a difference in the case of itself being a dangerous problem. Traffic accidents happen in split instances, being inattentive for even 5 seconds is already potentially dangerous.

I've to be clear I'm not condoning inattentive driving when I say it's *not serious*,  but I'm personally not bothered by it because most of the people who somehow use phone while riding motorbikes are people who use Google Maps, especially those with phone mounted on the bike. In the case of ride-hailing drivers, they are simply people who's spending a few seconds pressing accept/decline button, looking up booked client or looking at the map. I'm not overly fussy about this. It's something that I can tolerate by avoiding them as long as they only be distracted for a few seconds and for good reason. The people that can't be avoided are those who engage in dangerous manoeuvrings. Most accidents in Vietnam are caused by attentive people who drive recklessly.

^(If the phone is not mounted on the bike, it's just difficult to be distracted by phone. I mean, you can't really ride the bike while using phone unless you are asking for accident. Even among people who use phone mounted on bike, I see them quite responsible and they know it's risky so they don't use much like in other countries. So in Vietnam's context, using of phone while driving isn't really a problem because no people on the right mind would do it except those who have the right tool \(mount the device on bike\), and even so, it's not very bad because they all take their own precautions while being distracted i.e. driving very slowly.)

>Take a 15min trip around the city and see how many tech-app motorbike riders, what % of them riding around twiddling on their phones. Tell me those riders are middle/upper class.

For ""time efficiency"" excuse you came up ostensibly for lower-income people, I've explained many times it's NOT a valid excuse for dangerous driving at all. Time efficiency matters to everyone, it materially impacts others' jobs even for those whose jobs are not driving-related. There is only 24 hours each day, and the amount of time being stuck on the road affects everyone's total working hours, including white-collar work. And for driving-related jobs, there is a physical limitation to how much deliveries/rides one can make in a day, and the person who consciously signed up for that job has to accept the financial remuneration ceiling for that job. If the job can only pays that amount, then it's the limit for the job. **Maximizing income by breaking road rules is effectively making money out of endangering the safety of the driver and others, which is wrong.** There are many poor people who doesn't do driving-related jobs, and they do not selfishly make money by putting others in danger.

>It's not like you can tell them ""Hey go get a job as a security guard or a parking attendent"". Low-income people don't have much option when it comes to jobs.

This is not true. Security guard and parking attendant are also poor people and they don't make money off endangering the safety of others. The requirement to be security guard and parking attendant varies by employer, but it's not tough at all. In fact, I think security guard and parking attendant may make less money than a Grab driver. So stop portraying ride-hailing drivers or shippers as poor people who have the right to drive recklessly on the basis of their socioeconomic status, they make more money than a security guard or parking attendant by putting themselves and others' in danger."

Haha, maybe just that I've seen more tech-app bike riders using facetime, watching tiktok, scrolling facebook, texting, etc. more than you. Again, reckless driving cause more accidents. Sure. Being inattentive on phone may be less directly involved in causing accidents, but it surely contributes to bad traffic. You say it ""not being serious"" only means ""not causing serious accidents"", but the nature of the action having the potential of causing serious accidents is already serious. For example if you think about it logically, when someone driving behind a slow texting rider, they'd want to overtake them, impatiently switch lanes, then boom. Not to mention people who are on their phones while driving, are less likely to use turn-signal, or properly use their rearview mirror. 

>For ""time efficiency"" excuse you came up ostensibly for lower-income people, I've explained many times it's NOT a valid excuse for dangerous driving at all.

Um i dont get it. Are you arguing against my point? nothing is a valid excuse for reckless driving, but there are still people who do it out there. Like actually go out on the streets, especially where they shippers pick up their parcels, and see how many of them run a red light, driving on the wrong side of the road, overloading. Sometimes their cargo is so big you can't even see their rearview mirror from behind. You tell me that's safe. And that's only one example. 

Yes people who work those jobs, consciously signed up for it, but it's not like they have more options for other type of jobs. Yes there're actual limitations on how much they can make, and they're out their maximizing it, pushing the limits, because the job doesn't pay well. Just simply look at the cab drivers for example, they drive like shit, because the faster they finish one ride, they're available for more potential rides. 

Yes, white-collar workers are also affected by time on the road, but they can manage that by, for example, getting up earlier. Time efficiency is different from Time management. And people whose earnings don't depend on the amount of time of them being on the road, can manage their time. 

Of course there are many people out there don't selfishly make money by putting others in danger, but here's the bad news. There're not that many. 

All of this is just one of many reasons why VN traffic is bad. They, people who drive/ride to live, are not the only culprit.  Drive around town more, maybe you'll see more."
">Haha, maybe just that I've seen more tech-app bike riders using facetime, watching tiktok, scrolling facebook, texting, etc. more than you.

Oh, just be clear, I don't support or condone this at all. When I was being lenient to inattentive people, I was thinking of Grab riders driving slowly near the pedestrian looking for their customer or shipper looking around searching for address. I didn't have intention to give a benefit of doubt for those who video call, use TikTok, scrolling Facebook, etc. These are reckless and dangerous people and I do not support or tolerate them at all. I apologize for the misunderstanding.

>Um i dont get it. Are you arguing against my point?

I don't like anyone excusing reckless driving so I quickly refuted comments that may be seen as excusing reckless driving so other readers would not passively accept explanation of being poor or driving job for reckless driving as justification (which is very common in Vietnam as many readers mistake exchanging of ideas online for possible reasons as authoritative justification of the wrongdoing act), even if the commenter didn't have an explicit intent to excuse reckless driving for those reasons.

It's too common for people to justify reckless driving by highlighting they/the person is/are poor and whatsnot, and I already know most of the reckless driving in Vietnam come from that demographic, but I don't support or tolerate it at all on the basis of socioeconomic status.

>Yes, white-collar workers are also affected by time on the road, but they can manage that by, for example, getting up earlier. Time efficiency is different from Time management. And people whose earnings don't depend on the amount of time of them being on the road, can manage their time.

The *time management* being done here is actually being acceptance of the inherent limit that there is a limited number of working hours a day, thus accordingly allocate the amount of time to be wasted on the roads for transportation.

I find that in Vietnam I unfortunately spend more time travelling than some other ASEAN countries. Amount of time spent on road directly affect available time to be monetized, which in turn affect income.

>Of course there are many people out there don't selfishly make money by putting others in danger, but here's the bad news. There're not that many.

This is a problem in Vietnam and I hate it a lot. People only think about themselves and disregard how their actions or behaviours may negatively affect others."
Glad everyone was ok.
And people look at me like an insane man when I drive slow and pay attention to blind spots
"I’m glad everyone is okay! It could have been very tragic, but yes driving in Vietnam with any vehicle is unsafe. 

Just curious if you had to report the accident to grab?"
"Grab drivers are always too confident in their “skills”, that’s why there is always accidents, big or small"
"This is one of the reasons I don't tell my grab driver to go a different way (a better way through my experience). I always let them follow whatever the map says and what they decide to do.
If I tell them to go this way or that way or turn here or go down this road instead, and they end up getting in an accident along the way. Well, then I feel partly to blame."
"I've seen people die, but they were clearly intoxicated. 

Don't drive drunk and if you are driving, keep constant awareness. Years ago, one man rocketed from a bar directly into my motorbike and I was driving near the center of the road. Luckily, I swerved and there was minimal damage. Random things happen on these streets. But I haven't had any accidents since then. And I still recommend driving to people coming here to work. If you practice and stay vigilant, it's safer than anyone else driving you. The key word is ""practice"" though. An African friend of mine immediately drove on the freeway after getting here without any practice. You know what happened next. He's lucky he lived."
"Thank the gods no one was hurt, but I must say, I've never understood the whole U turn in the middle of a busy street thing. It happens all the time on my street and by the time the driver completes his ""20"" point turn, there is traffic backed up in both directions, except for the motorcycles that just drive by or take the sidewalk.

I've visited many countries but I don't recalling seeing this dangerous, and very inconvenient to other drivers, maneuver to the same extent.

Is this just a Vietnam thing?"
"It’s a shit show on the roads, fucking idiots literally every where"
Im in Hoi An and witnessing so many foreigners riding badly and too fast. Was wondering what the accident rate in this town was as Ive seen several ambulances in one night. Not something you see that much in Vietnam. Funnily enough guy at table next to me tells me he is the head doctor at the hospital here and his team have worked on six Australians today and plenty of others. All traffic accidents! Go easy everyone
Vietnam is not for the occasional motorcyclist. You’d need extensive riding experience across several countries to be able to ride here. There is zero consideration for other motorists. ‘He who dares wins’ type of attitude. Nothing short of aggressive riding will work here. Hesitation is a killer.
"I saw 5 accidents in 1 week here in honoi. Every time I drive I try not to get to complacent , a crash is going to come to everyone if you stay here long enough"
"It’s not an anarchic driving style. Once you start driving everything makes sense, yes it makes sense everything they do in traffic once you drive. If you drive please be careful until you get used to it."
The stress of always being on alert while driving is extremely exhausting.
"Thank god no one got hurt. We Vietnamese are good with the motorbike, not with cars."
"  ,       I 🍷🙄😒🤫🏡"
"Thank the gods no one was hurt, but I must say, I've never understood the whole U turn in the middle of a busy street thing.

"When I visited Vietnam for the first time, I was shocked when no one drives within their lane"
"Any slow and safe maneuvers to western standards are dangerous in Vietnam. 
You gotta be fast.

The biggest killer though is zoning out. 

Stay safe everyone and don’t drink/drive."
Your final line sums it up perfectly.
Nhuooibừ:)))))
"Yikes, glad you're OK. I only just got here, but I find the driving a bit more tame than Bali, where I just came from.  That said, have only taken a few rides so far and why are they making turns from the far opposite lanes? What's up with that lol!"
You don't have to live here very long before that happens.
"Did he not honk before he turned? I have learned that's the proper way. Blinkers are optional of course, but honking is mandatory.

Seriously though, I am really glad everyone was ok. I once saw a mother and infant on a moped get wiped out by a sedan. The mother was unconscious and someone was shaking the baby. I have no idea what happened to them because our bus just kept going. I won't let my children ride on mopeds after seeing it. Scary stuff."
By a split hair though. One meter before and it would have hit the door I was sitting next to and I would have probably gotten hurt.
"Something I learned many years ago in Vietnam which is true if you are in HCMC or HN : You don't need to check your blind spot because there is ALWAYS someone in your blind spot, any side, any time, any place."
It’s an assumption isn’t it? They’re being curious though
I didn't have to report anything.
"Well in my case, had he heeded my advice he wouldn't have gotten in an accident. Unfortunately he didn't understand me when I told him I wanted to cross the street on my own."
Indeed
"That's just so not true lol. 

You need to learn the jungle rules, but it's actually a lot easier to drive/ride here, compared to even Europe, because everyone here assumes no-one knows how to drive (which is true, 8 year old kids ride here on broken bikes). I can vouch that if you learned in EU, and got familiar with the jungle rules, you're immediately better and safer than 99.9999% of Vietnamese traffic who don't even know basic rules or mechabics of driving and the roads are designed around them here, they're very simple, everything is intuitive and braindead. 

The first time I drove/rode anything was in Vietnam and I was underaged and somewhat drunk, rode for hours with no problem. 

Europe? 6 month long driving license course, very hard test practical and theoretical, still, crashed a couple weeks later  because I misunderstood a complicated intersection, got almost hit by another car, did some wild maneuver, slid on ice and into a ditch. Because here EVERYONE is assumed to be a perfect driver already. So no honking, no being careful, no looking around just in case. Fuck up and you get fucked up."
"I know you truly believe that, but the average foreigner is a better motorbike driver after 1 year in Vietnam than the average Vietnamese driver who has been at it his or her whole life. "
"Let’s talk about what we can define by ‘good driver’ . One can be able to operate both cars and motorbikes very well, but his decision making on the road might be terrible and dangerous. What I’m trying to say is anybody can drive either transport successfully, but how you act on the road and towards other people using the road is the main point here. I can name many things which the Vietnamese do completely different than people from foreign countries, but there is no point :)) . For example, it is socially acceptable here to cut someone off , or not look left or right when joining the main road. Now ask me what is the main road, because there is no such thing as that here"
"I feel it depends on how you define good.


Not bad at riding control yeah I'll give you that, although nothing special tbh. 


Being good road sensible users in traffic, lol no. "
He didn't honk. I think there was something wrong with this guy. Maybe he was drunk or overworked. He wasn't acting normally.
We all need a reminder sometimes that we make those assumptions.
No passenger seatbelts when in a Grab car is always a reportable or a downgraded rating criterion/comment for me.
True. I drive like an absolute f wit here just because everyone does. My corner is coming up in 30 metres? I may as well just cut across onto the wrong side of the ride to get there sooner now
"Nah, I believe you"
Then you have the foreigners who get super salty about the way it works here and make everything worse. Almost got t-boned by one because after however much time he's been here he still doesn't get that cars have the right of way and scooters either have to stop or go around.
You just reminded me to start reporting. I hate when they do this
Never had one without seat belt. I always wear it.
"Haha, don't do that! 

My girlfriend yells at me to ""drive like everyone else"" while pointing at people behaving like complete idiots, because it's ""safer"", took a while to bring her to the ""dark side"" of proper, safe and  proactive rather than purely reactive driving behavior. 

Some of these accident deaths should be ruled suicides..."
I drive both a car and motorbike. You just drive like an A-hole. Who has the right of way is dictated by who is on the major road and who is turning onto it and who is in the left lane and who is in the right lane. You are proving my point.
"In the passenger back seat, sometimes the Grab drivers intentionally render the existing seatbelts unusable by clipping them back behind the seat or otherwise making them inaccessible by putting the seatbelts under an unnecessary seat cover, irrespective of passenger comments or complaints, thereby deserving of any negative feedback sent to Grab. Nonexistent basic safety awareness and practices. Never seen this happen with rideshare services in any other country."
Might also happen with drivers in Indonesia
"Lol first it would be nice if people actually stopped at red lights in general, also if they didn’t start going 3 sec before it turns green"
"Been in VN for 5 years. Absolutely hate the way locals drive and now I’ve become a product of what I hate. Turning right where there is no right arrow. Jumping pavements, etc. Only because I know I can. In full view of traffic cops. No one gives a fuck and I get home earlier.

Be the change you want to see in the world? Yup that didn’t work."
"Lái xe ở VN 99% ng ko hiểu right of way. 

Mình đi thẳng, nó rẽ hay chuyển làn thì phải chạy chậm đợi merge vô làn mới. Nhưng ko, nó thấy half a space là cứ cắt ngang mặt xe mình xong bị tai nạn thì bảo do mình chạy nhanh / ẩu ? Wtf , chạy kiểu đường của bố mày. 

Xe máy xe hơi y như nhau. Thấy space là tràn vào, ko cần biết luật lệ gì hết"
Vietnamese right of way is clear means i go
"Red light in vietnam is just there for decoration. They just go as they please and somehow always manage to dodge one another. It's been like that since I was a lil boy when the only traffic light I have in my hometown is at a big intersection. And when new light get added, people doesn't seem to follow it because they so use to driving without 1."
The problem is during rush hours you could wait forever till you have the right of way to turn left. What really boils my blood are idiots wait for green light to turn left in the middle lane.
I see there are dedicated lane for right turn with barrier on Pham Van Dong
"Actually, turning right during the red light is not national law. In Gia Lai and some other cities, if you do that you will need to fund the traffic police mansion. It is not officially stated in traffic regulation that you can turn right   at the red light, especially with the car you can't. But does it prevent them from turning? No. I am currently in Hanoi for work, Dai Co Viet street near Thong Nhat Park, you can see people ignore the red light every now and then. The line is non-existent to them.

Vietnamese don't follow the rules very well. Honestly, I don't know how to fix that."
Vn got shit civil engineering AND road ethics
"Yeah the way people drive around makes me wanna bludgeon someone. I do not understand the reason why they always honk when there are like 5 seconds left before turning green, y'all have diarrhea or something?"
Looks like someone got to work late due to traffic jam.
So what's the solution? Banning all left turns?
"How was it inspired by the US? The US, there’s a dedicated time slot for left turns on either side. Vietnam has no such thing so on some streets, you will wait for all eternity. There needs to be something to wait for or people will not wait."
"""was inspires by US"" is a weird way to say you can't handle our local traffic sir."
I make sure there’s no cops and no1 gonna drive into me. Then I go. A lot of drivers are kind. Coulda hit me and woulda been my fault. Vice versa also though. Be kind. Don’t hit me.
"the thing is everyone's on the same page. sure, it seems ""chaotic"" in the beginning, but once you adopt the local habits, traffic is predictable/easy."
"r/Vietnam bingo post of the day ""traffic is better where I come from because my country is smarter"", yah too bad adapt like the rest of us, life gets better when you embrace new things instead of reflexively disliking them."
"Changing the traffic behaviour would lead to a total collapse of traffic.

Before having a metro in all of the Vietnamese metropoles fixing traffic is a bad idea."
Wait until you visit other developed democratic countries nearby. Much worse.
[deleted]
No left turn on ahead green light is much more pleasant for pedestrians.
People have to learn the right of way when they take a driving license test. They just choose to forget it after that 😂
"It is also a thing in finland. But they ultilize the left turn green light a lot.

Regarding the right of way, it is because of those crappy car drivers who go on to Facebook and spread bullcrap."
There's traffic lights?
This country needs more roundabouts. They are way more conducive to the local style of driving. No need to stop.
"There are actually some turn-only lanes, and lights with green arrow left turn phases. The roads I've seen it are where the motorbikes have a separate portion of the road on the right, separated from trucks and cars by a barrier. It works ok except that whoever set it up messed up the timing badly, and if you're turning left in the last 5-10 seconds of the left arrow green timer, the people going the opposite direction on the other motorbike lane will have their green circle light turned green while you're still going through the intersection.. So you get a solid group of people accelerating off the line on course to crash into you."
Red light is optional
Lmao… rules
How about people drive on the correct side of the road before thinking about more complex situations like a traffic light junction.
"You can say the same about roundabouts… no one’s got a clue what’s going on.

Country road system is managed very poorly and no one gives a f&@$"
I dont even know if there’s a point talking about traffic in Vietnam
"I walked around Nha Trang last year.  Vietnam doesn't even deserve the convenience of pedestrian crossings.  There were cars that were accelerating  through even while I was crossing.  I gave one of them the finger, but not sure if they knew what that was."
"The left/right turn green arrow needs to be implemented while opposing traffic has a red. The concept of ""right of way"", as you said, doesn't exist and probably never will."
Right. Every intersection should just have roundabouts like Europe. The lights are almost meaningless. They need to enforce people driving onto the sidewalks. It's a joke. That sort of stuff turns off tourists.
"Turning left first against traffic in America usually always accompanies a green arrow first. Ngu du
                                                                                   ."
Good luck everybody else...
Look both ways even on one way streets . Look both ways constantly because vehicles and bikes sometimes speed up when they see a human in their path
"A lot of the times I think to myself 'Gee, having a left turn signal here would be great.' But then I remembered that it won't work because cars are always on the left. This means motorbikes have cut off cars (or god forbid properly merge into the lanes) to turn left. It sucks but that's how it is."
As a regular Vietnamese would say: What red light?
"I once heard it said, “it’s going to turn green anyway so what’s the point?” True story."
The combination of lights that countdown to being green and Vietnamese drivers is so dangerous. Why do they have countdowns on the red lights??
"Yeah, can't agree anymore with you about that but if I stay until the color change, the crowds behind me will start honking the car horn and sometimes I heard a few of insults. It's make sense  that in the peak hours, a policeman is needed more than a group of traffic light because they are afraid that he could affect their money (of course, direct fines) instead of obeying the law at the harmless traffic light."
Haha yeah. You can’t educate them with your polite driving. Most likely they will just sigh and think.. troi oi another foreigner trying to ride a bike.
Wtf is this google translate or vietkieu way of talking
and not clear means I go anyways but slowly
"Actually love that they implemented it, it was terrible without it."
"Correct, the junctions in VN that allow turning right on red usually have signages specifying that you can do so. But who the hell cares right?"
"fyi, there are a few specific roads that allowed turning right on a red light. Ngã 3 Hoa Lư in Pleiku, Gia Lai comes to mind."
"Got stopped by police for doing this, I was at fault and I'll admit that. Today I was aggressively ""honked"" by a car at the same place for ""blocking"", even though it was red light. I give up"
"Nah, looks like some people got their soft vietnamese feelings hurt. Go ahead and downvote this."
"It's so telling that ""better education"" is so rarely brought up as a resolution for anything in Vietnam lmfao"
Have a separate phase for left turns.
Traffic cops who do anything would be a start (instead of sitting at the corner and flagging down expensive looking cars and pretty girls)
Roundabouts. Roundabouts are so much more friendly to the Vietnamese style of driving.
I'll make 4 right turns then
"Not sure which states you're talking about. But when i was in New York, there are solid green lights that allow drivers to turn when there's no incoming traffic. Some however, are in the shape of arrow, for that it is different, you can only go when its green.

And you said it yourself, there needs to be something to wait for = opposing traffic. But this isn't the case in Vietnam am i right? Oncoming cars or bikes, we go, no one has right of way, no one has the patience to wait."
"Imagine being proud of this hellhole take on traffic. Do you look at Jakarta and think ""fuck I cant wait for this to be HCM and Hanoi!"""
"Thanks for proving my point. ""Won't admit it"" Keep loving your country like this my man."
"You’re at the wrong place then, this is reddit"
"Ah the metro, love to hear it, how's it coming along, they done with seats yet?"
"My job requires me to visit ID, PH, SG, MY once every quarter, so i'm familiar. The reason we're not there yet is because majority of vehicles in VN are still motorcycles. You don't think the same or worse will happen to us when the number of cars continues to increase?

Not to mention the roads here aren't exactly well designed for cars. If the current situation is already this bad with motorcycles, imagine them with cars."
"Look ahead my friend, cars are increasing YOY in VN. We will be like them or worse in the future. Stop only looking at present.  


And why are we comparing Vietnam to other countries? It's an issue in Vietnam and it requires a vietnamese solution."
Gotta love the whataboutism
"Hell yeah let’s accept being bad because other people are also bad, awesome mentality my brother"
Surely it's not allowed if someone is crossing the road that they are turning into?
Seriously? That's amazing. Can you remember the wording in Vietnamese?
So they know if it’s worth stopping 5m away in a shadow
"I'd say it's the best thing ever, Europe needs that shit!

Also helps you to predict when people will start driving."
Đi thẳng trên 1 làn thì là ng có right of way. Most of the time. Có gì mà ko hiểu bạn ơi
Like why do they care when the traffic police ignore it also.
Yup i only cares about that i got home soon
"Like OP said some junctions allow that, and this rule applies to all cities but in Hanoi and HCM people ignore it. I mentioned Gia Lai since my friend got caught there due to that rule, we were all surprised since nobody taught us about it in HCM."
Not at all. I admit the traffic is a mess. But I think you're hurt more than me. Cheer.
"They are educated at all levels and they chose to ignore it. How do you do it better? They teach you to respect traffic light ftom kindergarten all the way to highschool. They teach you to respect traffic laws everywhere. Same for littering. 

Better education was never a solution if people just do what is convenient for them. And people with no education would just blatantly skip all the rules because they would rather annoy you fot all they care.

The root of all problems, simply put, lies in parenting. Kids follow what they see. Parents have more access to kid's behaviour and punishment at times. Again, schools taught them those but it is pointless if you don't make yourself a model for the children."
"Awareness doesn't mean anything if people don't give a damn, mate."
People would just turn left again anyway when the light is solid green again unless they change country wide law and turn only on the green arrow. That would take a long time to enforce.
I love when a two lane road suddenly becomes one lane because of the left turn phase. That left turn lane is mostly empty while the single lane going straight is jam packed! 😅
"The solid green light is only used in places that aren’t busy. Rural or suburban roads. Busy/major intersections use combination of green arrows and green light. If there’s no green arrows, you will wait at the green light forever without ever getting a chance to turn. That’s what I mean. 

Vietnam does not have green arrows to ensure you have a time to turn left no matter how busy the road is. You can’t copy the system half way and expect it to work. As an American in vietnam, I’m not waiting for an hour for an opportunity to turn left without the green arrow. I’m just gonna go because that’s how vietnam traffic lights are designed. 

It’s not about people not waiting for their turn. No one will wait for an hour just to turn left on a busy intersection. The system does not reward waiting. It punishes you. 

It’s a faulty design. Vietnam May have been inspired by American traffic lights but failed horribly at implementing them because it provides no solution for left turns at busy intersection. Should have just stuck to roundabouts."
"there is nothing in my sentence that says ""proud""

OP stated that Vietnamese didn't deserve the traffic light conveniences, which was ""inspired by the US"" while Vietnameses didn't ""understand the right of way"".

we're Vietnamese, and even if our traffic sucks to the point of nothing will simply fix it, it's Vietnamese traffic and we live with it day by day, waking up at 9 only to arrive at work at freaking 10 because people can't handle a traffic light right.

don't bring your US logic in here."
They’re adding a massage function to all the seats. That’s what’s taking so long.
"Interesting.

You think it doesn't happen in countries like Taiwan? Trust me, I've seen more accidents due to left-hand turns on motorcycles and cars driving over pedestrian walkways with green pedestrian lights with people in Taiwan within two years versus my many years in Vietnam -- one almost hit a woman walking with her baby carriage at night, nearby Burger King in Taipei. Even my employee drove her Mini Cooper from the far right side of the four lane road to turn left driving across someone else's path, every morning when I was working there. I'm not kidding.

The drive in Vietnam versus other places, black and white. Vietnamese don't want to pay 20\~30 USD fine to traffic cops on a 300 USD salary. That's too much for them. That's why Vietnamese tend to drive 60km in a 80km road. 80km in a 100km expressway. Why we stop before the RED LIGHT turns on. We also have traffic cameras that do mail traffic violations to violators. We tend to drive slowly. What you described isn't an isolated case but can describe the roads of Taiwan where majority of people still drive scooters on a 1,100 USD white-collar per month salary."
"No worries. Cars are on track to be banned from cities centers. Give it time. I wouldn't want half of the city to be parking spaces. Besides, cities would be safer with less cars."
"Greenlight for ahead vehicle is also green light for pedestrians walking parellel, but vehicles turning left literally cut through the currently green zebra crossing. Drivers won't wait (obviously), which means on greenlight pedestrians isn't safe. Not allowing simultaneous left turn means that theorically pedestrians are walking side by side and ""shielded"" by the traffic, and they can wait out dedicated left turn phase with a clear red pedestrian light."
HAHAHAHAHA
That quote was a friend translating for me. The original I’m not so sure!
I can think of ways to let people know it’s going to be a bit of a wait without having an exact countdown timer like it’s the start of a race.
They’re badly implemented. You could give people an idea of if they have a long or short wait without the dangers of the starting pistol of the current system.
Chèn tiếng anh và tiếng việt thì nói gg translate ra thì không hiểu là phải rồi
"Yeah, definitely not all roads allowed that. I was the opposite though. Never knew you could turn right on a red light so it caught me off guard back when I was still new to commuting. 


There usually is a big arrow turning to the right graffiti on the road + a sign that said the road specifically allowed it but uh, guess I was blind back then."
Hurt from the mess in vietnam’s traffic? yea you’re right. Btw i know you guys dont like pronouncing “s” in words but its Cheers*. Cheers.
Hopefully after a few generations we're finally going to see a domino effects of people finally respecting traffic laws being in the majority 😔
Bruh parents dump kids on teachers and expect them to fix everything about their kid in this country. There's no hope there.
"I talk about it in another comment but the other part of this madness is the traffic police and their uhm... ""work"" here"
"Good thing about this is they have already started doing something about it. Barriers, signages, changes of that solid green light to arrow green. Some junctions were so bad they actually made these changes pretty actively."
"Not sure where you are at, but in hcmc/ binh duong/ long an/ vung tau, they have plenty of turn only on green arrow lanes. They work well and I’ve never seen a driver turn on the red arrow."
"That's right. The solid green light to turn left doesn't work here simply because there are too many vehicles on too small of a road. That, combining with the ""me first"" mindset in Vietnam = disaster.

Exactly what I'm trying to say. Why implement it when we don't have the mentality & infrastructure to pull it off?"
"Seeing the scenario played out as explained by the OP is extremely common here and they're entirely right on the point of ""yielding"" as a concept DOES NOT exist here and it's an otherwise vital part of traffic.

You're being a great example of the low traffic understanding here since you completely missed his point, the green left turn into an oncoming lane is a US traffic setup, much like how US traffic lets you make a right turn even on a red light in cases.

But rules like that need drivers that are better educated (and US drivers license training is a JOKE), so it needs to start from the ground up and educate people better and more strictly enforce drivers licenses and proper training.  


But that's very unlikely to happen anytime soon since the traffic police make their money... differently."
"Sorry, what's your point mate? 

No one here is talking about other countries. I'm talking about Vietnam in the Vietnam community. My point is that specific law that requires yielding & right of way simply doesn't work in Vietnam.

Nothing to do with monthly salary, nothing to do with speed, nothing to do with fine. Read again please."
"That would be great. Indonesia and Philippines both have their respective carpooling policies enforced by the government. They call it number coding, which could be a good alternative too."
"This is why media is important because it’s the quickest way to get to people like this. 

If they’re stigmatised for saying/doing stupid things they will stop. 

A video of a person saying this and then causing an accident is perfect to show these people. But our media agencies aren’t that great…
What do we spend all this money on?!"
Well on a more honest note I kinda usually adjust my speed according to the countdown so I don’t have to stop at all (plus avoid the exhaust smoke from everyone waiting in the front). Most of the people though just try to squeeze themselves to the pole position.
"You're the first one I've 'met' that dislikes the countdown, not being sarcastic.

Everyone I know in Europe thinks it's an amazing upgrade to traffic lights. The implementation is perfectly fine, it's the attitude of the drivers."
"That's very kind of you to help me with my English, good sir."
"We said that every ten years and spoiled kids grew up to be spoiled adults teaching spoiled kids again 😂

I worked in QTSC for years, it is a complex with a mixed of office buildings and universities. And trust me, the students were so carelessly walking on the street without minding surroundings. And their motorbike riding is even worse. Looking at them I didn't think our next generation could be much better...

And I don't know how we could solve jaywalking. People even jaywalk just a few metres away from zebra crossings..."
"The problem is, when they turn a green light lane into a green arrow lane, you are basically taking one lane out of service. So for example you have a two lane road, green light / arrow intersection coming up. The left lane will suddenly, and I mean suddenly ‘convert’ into a turn only lane. This means all traffic going straight will have to merge right. Another famous problem here. Yield/ Merge. 😅"
"We’re not saying the same thing. Solid green circle cannot work alone. Even in the US. It needs to work with the green ARROW. Which does not exist in vietnam. People’s mentality in VN would change if they can actually turn left in the current system, but they can’t so they understandably don’t.

You can’t implement a faulty system in vietnam then blame people when it doesn’t work."
"Agree with you my man, you can already see the issue within their replies on this thread. Unfortunately the locals prefer sticking to the status quo and not change anything before it is too late. 

And when its mentioned or discussed, they get defensive like its the worst thing ever to admit it. Isn't this the first step to improving just about everything? 

Then come the arguments ""don't bring your US logic here"" ""go home if you don't like it"" ""this country doesn't belong to you"". But we love this country too, hell some of us even paid more taxes than majority of the locals. So why not take a listen, discuss, and grow."
">Sorry, what's your point mate? 

""Whataboutism"" coming from an inferiority comlex. Next they will say ""if you don't like it, go home"". 

You said something negative about Vietnam, so the thin-skinned nationalists only hear that and feel compelled to shout you down and point out that other countries have the same problem.

That's why it's so hard to improve things in places like Vietnam. The idea of ""saving face"" means that admitting to a problem is a big no-no. And if you can't admit to a problem, you can't fix it."
"My point? Just live with it.

That's it. I drive everyday in Vietnam. 23km there, 23km back home. I don't think too much about the tiny situations that occur daily. It may feel like a skin prick but there's only so much you can control. Anyway, just go out and drink tonight and get some frog legs. I am with my family."
Number coding doesn't work people just buy multiple cars
"Back in the time you could saw plenty of ads about stop smoking/drinking and safety stuff on VTV

Now it's just household shits and drugs, one could say those ads is more profitable for them...gotta do everything for the big bucks"
"Yeah this is really annoying, why don't more people slow down as they approach a red? Surely it's a very natural move, but people just speed past you and then stop. Very annoying."
"If the intention is so people don’t have to stop, they should build more roundabouts. 

And you could still achieve your goal of not stopping without an *exact* countdown timer like a race."
I like the countdown. I think it’s not perfect. I think it’s dangerous for how the locals treat the rules.
"Yeah it's pretty damn bad, gotta do what we gotta do to sleep well at night though 😓


I lived in a city in the highlands for a pretty long time. Roads here are pretty damn big and is developed after HN/SG, so cars and such are somewhat accounted for. Even then, the traffic was a ""mess"", especially around schools and the likes where cars and scooters would literally wrestle for space.


After going to SG and other cities more than a dozen time, I really, really appreciate the roads here now though. God at least I don't get washed away like ants in SG."
"You're right, but i think its worse if its green circle light, you'll end up with cars and bikes getting stuck in the middle of the junction, and imagine if its a 4 way crossroad, no one's going anywhere."
"I still think green arrows would've worked better than solid greens, all you gotta do is wait, and fine those who stop in the middle of the junction. Sure its not favorable to wait, but whos to say solid green lights aren't worse? I personally think solid green lights cause worse jams in a bigger scale, whereas green arrows still provide some sense of systematic flow.

And I'm not blaming the people, im blaming the you-know-who that decided to go with this system without rationalizing the vietnamese driving behavior.

You can't add leniency on an already such carefree driving culture."
"""Just live with it"" - everyone, this is exactly why."
"In Vietnam, common sense is not so common."
Have you seen the roundabouts in Vietnam? 😂
"Vietnamese roundabouts are actually extremely unsafe and inconvenient. 

You dislike the countdown, you like dangerous roundabouts,... You backwards or something? Hahaha"
Pretty sure the locals would find ways to game the system whatever traffic signaling method you throw at them. For example if they see that the pedestrian light is changing… it’s time to fly.
Pick your poison. The intersection will be clear but the road trying to go straight will be congested. 🙃
"There is no green arrow is better than green circles. That’s nonsense. You can’t use the green arrows without the green circle. You can’t use the green circle without the green arrow. You need both. Which is what the American system is. I’m not sure if you fully understand the American system based on our conversation. 

If you take Americans system and placed it in vietnam, it would work.

Problem is entirely the current half assed system in vietnam, not peoples mentality."
Yes. They work better and are safer. Of course neither is a perfect solution.
"If you think those are dangerous, you should see the signalized intersections. Studies show roundabouts are both safer and cheaper to build."
"The American system has turn only lanes which is the green arrow. They also have that here in VN and it’s an absolute disaster because it is a regular lane taken out of service to be used as a turning lane.

The American system also has a non turning only lane which is the green circle. That is the yield OP is referring to.

In the US there are also both options on some intersections, green arrow means go and the green circle means yield. Nothing like that exists here to my knowledge and experience. I would love to see this implemented though.

But what about those roundabouts? Everyone has the right a way, and yield to what? Everyone just keeps on going! Hence the clusterfu*k in the driving culture here.

Don’t get me started on the lack of stop signs! lol"
"I don't think you get my point mate. That's exactly what im talking about. Vietnam junctions have only 1 at a time, never both together. Thats why it doesn't work.

Try thinking bigger, systems should be built based on mentality & behavior, if not then they're simply baseless. For example, think why was covid lockdown implemented, why were masks mandatory, why are there traffic rules for DUI, seatbelts, etc. These are to regulate against human behavior and ensure safety & efficiency for everyone else. If you implement green circle lights and expect Vietnamese to yield for opposing traffic, then that's simply isn't justified because we know patience isn't a strong suit here.

Keep up my man."
"Where do you live in Vietnam, if I may ask?

Because I'm guessing you haven't seen many roundabouts here at all. The results of your studies definitely don't apply to a country where the traffic so chaotic...

Not ALL roundabouts are safer, they also have to be designed right or the flow will be garbage (like most big roundabouts in Saigon, where I live, they are deathtraps).

Sorry, the roundabouts in Vietnam are not even close to actual efficient roundabouts. You can try to argue, but I live here and drive here."
Hanoi. Roundabouts work much better in a country where people don’t like to stop.
"Well, go to Saigon and you'll see how not to build roundabouts.

On some roundabouts you can end up driving into cars from the other direction because of how poorly everything is designed. You're following the circle and suddenly you're greeted with highway traffic because of how sharp the bend is. I've passed it a 100 times and the single tiny stop sign there still pisses me off.

There are ways to simulate it, but I'm really not up to that. I have a degree in logistics and I enjoy traffic management. You can take my word for it, many of the roundabouts in Saigon are deathtraps.

I love driving a motorbike, fearless on the road since I was a kid. I've been in some extremely close calls in some of these roundabouts and it's all to blame on the lazy design."
"Where the heck are you in Hanoi? Roundabouts here are terrible here during rush hours and always congest. Roundabouts cant support heavy traffic, unless its efficiently designed, that's the thing."
I’ve lived in Saigon too. Saying that badly designed roundabouts exist doesn’t prove anything.
"I don’t think design would help here in any way. For most Vietnamese, a roundabout is basically an intersection without a traffic light and some inconvenient green stuff in the middle. With low traffic, I’m pretty sure some people would just turn left."
The normal intersections suck too
"You're literally talking to someone who's educated on this, but whatever. Maybe drive around the whole city instead of the usual foreign bubble here.

Roundabouts are awesome, but not when poor/lazy design and bad drivers are involved.

End of story, bed time."
"The design of some roundabouts in Saigon is really outrageous.

I agree with the rest. There are a bunch of roundabouts in my area and people constantly turn left on them... I can't believe anyone would call them safe in Vietnam. Maybe I'm just completely blind?"
"Intersections suck but roundabouts here suck more.

I see you're still dying on this hill even though you're a moron and completely wrong.

I love Reddit. Keep it up."
What makes you think you’re the only one educated on the matter?
Ha. Tell that to all the red light runners.
"My observation that you still didn't get what I meant, now stop it. This is not the hill to die on.

Drive around every district, not just the fake touristic areas, and visit every major roundabout (and look at satellite images during heavy traffic). Until you've done that, we're done talking.

Have a good evening."
And the stop sign runners.
God are you condescending. I get it. You clearly think I’ve never left D1. 🙄 Go fuck yourself.
"Sorry, you've proven nothing but incompetence. Study results don't apply to every country, averages are meaningless. I'm sorry for your ignorance."
Go to sleep. It’s past your bedtime.
You've proven my point. Good night.
"Gotta look both ways before stepping onto any street. 

Oh and people accelerate when they see a foreigner here "
Nearly is subjective. Eventually you develop a new definition for nearly.
"in short, yes

in long, yes"
"First 30 minutes of my experience in Vietnam was almost getting run over in Saigon, my parents always taught me to look both ways before crossing the street, but what I didn’t know, that in Vietnam I should look both ways while walking on the pavement 😆"
"This is the way (to cross the street in Vietnam):

![gif](giphy|l3fZIxZjUtnvrEmfS)"
"I was almost creamed one night in Dalat. I was timing the  on-coming traffic and was 3 seconds away from beginning a dash across the street but forgot to look the other way for people going the ""wrong"" way. The moto zipped past me about 3 inches away from me. One step forward and I would have been toast."
"One of the most dangerous places on earth, few countries have a higher motor vehicle fatality rate."
Absolutely
Nearly? I've had an hour of surgery from a 17 yo tre trau with no shirt or helmet hitting me in my lane running from a police checkpoint. I've also had a car just pull a uturn and hit me going straight. People here don't think about others especially when driving.
"The streets in Vietnam work kind of like the sidewalks, except that everyone is in a vehicle instead of walking. People follow traffic rules to a certain extend, but there is also a lot of flexibility in negotiating their way around. Think of how you negotiate your way to avoid other pedestrians while walking on a busy sidewalk."
[deleted]
Welcome to SEA hahahahaha
"Nealy getting hit?  So not actually getting hit? 

Yes. 

I walk around Vn and don't get hit by cars all the time."
"They’ll barely miss you but they will miss you. Nothing to do with your safety, it’s just their scooters are their livelihoods and they wouldn’t wanna wreck them. You can do them a favor by walking consistently so it doesn’t fuck up their timing."
U get used to it. It's safer than it feels at first.
"Yes, yes it is.

You are not really living in Vietnam if you don't get almost assassinated by stray vehicles every minute."
Sounds about right lol welcome to GTA Vietnam
First day?
"It's not personal, it's Vietnam."
"yes, i find it exciting. what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger."
"I ride one everyday for 2 years and have gotten hit twice during those 2 years, so the odds are once a year."
You should walk calm and slow not to slow.
"In Vietnam look both ways before stepping out into the street OR sidewalk. The sidewalk is just another roadway and parking spot. 

Also in blind small alleyways that lead up to a main road always pause and look before crossing it. People will just shoot out of those alleys going full speed sometimes."
It was for me lol 😂
Short answer: yup!
"Actually walking you just kinda inch it and they will overall go around you. You freak out and sit there you won't go anywhere and if you try and run you'll probably die. Riding a bike, yes, getting nearly hit is a daily occurrence."
Yes.
you are paranoid.
"Only if you're not near a road.
If you are, it's hourly, minutely or by the second."
"If your more than 5m away your a future problem, when your now 1m away your a suprise. Object permanence and future planning aren't really a thing for most drivers here. "
Difficulty level raised. Git gud
"Haha. I love the traffic. Game of chance for me and my travel insurance.

Honestly, I've been here roughly 2 months. Only now near the end of my trip have I been actually hit by people. 3 times, but it's mostly been side mirrors on scooters or handle bars when driving from behind me.

Speed is so slow here that it always felt like someone walking Into you rather than a vehicle hitting me.

I will say ive noticed more and more crashes Into each other. Yall play bumper bumper cars with scooters and sometimes the vars join in the fun.


But joking aside, it may seem like uncontrolled chaotic events. But it is for the most part controlled chaos. You get use to it lol."
"Vietnam Traffic is exactly like GTA, the only thing lacking is random people kick you out of your bike and steal it  =)))"
"> It's like Gta

Git gud"
"This is reason why i never let my wife ride bike or when we the kids. 

Book grab car only"
"As long as you walk predicably you're fine. If you ride on a motorbike you realize that drivers see you waaay before you see them. They've already routed around you before you would even notice them. And while you see 100 motorbikes, all 100 motorbikes see just 1 pedestrian and they are so easy to avoid as long as they don't do something stupid. Just walk slow and in a straight line and you'll be fine, even walking on the road."
Not if you look where you’re walking
"Nope, nope and nope, in fact accidents rate in the us far much more than VN, you should google it"
Yeah I heard and read that especially truck drivers love to scare foreigners or make it really difficult for them. (While driving a scooter or crossing the street)
Im Thai so i think i look local enough but i wasnt even on the street i was standing with a whole group of ppl so they were abt to run over all of us
All the new car owners love to assert dominance over the foreigner
This is the only correct answer
"In long, Yesssssssssssssssss"
Hahaha this is exactly how we all should do it.
You should also avoid dashing on the streets in Vietnam! It's better to walk calmly at normal speed so that people can see you and go around you
"Jezus always ALWAYS walk slowly and steadily across the street in VN, and  please do that in most developing countries that you visit"
"""I was almost creamed""

What"
Yeah it’s pretty high. Crazy that there is basically no rules when compared to other places
Thailand is worse but yeah it’s pretty high up there overall.
The scooter and cars that do sudden U-turns and not even using their turn signals are so scary.
"In Vietnam people will go around you. In Thailand, that simply doesn’t happen which is why it’s so dangerous there."
OP is Thai. Vietnam is in a totally different league to other SEA countries for crazy road crossing situations.
Well if i was hit i prolly wouldnt be writing that😭😭
Im flying back to bkk today but yeah when i posted it was the night after my first day
Makes you appreciate life more.
I was not trying to cross the street😔 i was on the pavement
"I was standing on the pavement and the van wouldve drove right into me if i hadnt moved the last sec, i dont think its paranoia"
I was walking slowly around a quiet part of Ha Noi one day when a motorbike clipped me from behind and sliced the back of my leg open. Even walking slowly you have to keep your head on a 360° swivel lol that's how uncoordinated vietnamese drivers are.
ADHD’er here. I have so many different walks. Most notably the zigzag. Damn.
US is 12.9 deaths per 100k and VN is 30.6
Time to walk around with a brick
I think it’s more that truck drivers don’t give a shit about anyone. Always yield to truck drivers because they’re large and they don’t care.
It’s a game of chicken for sure 
That's what she said
"Yeah consistent speed is best, be predictable!"
I would rather wait for a good break in the flow and quickly get across than pray nobody will hit me.
Im from Thailand and what ive experienced there isnt even comparable to the near death experiences ive had in Vietnam after being here for 2 days😭😭
[deleted]
It’s either skydiving or walking across the streets of HCMC.
There is only danger walking between parked scooters and traffic 😞.
"That sucks. Probably weren’t trying to kill you, just the usual morons. Spatial awareness is also very important for pedestrians."
Yeah don't do that on the road. Not just for your own safety but you'll make people crash into each other trying to avoid you.
